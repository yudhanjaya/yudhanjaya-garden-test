As I go through life, I find myself left with things I don’t quite have a use for, but have some sentimental value regardless. Plastic boxes full of memorabilia; a storage room full of odds and ends; magazines and books that I’ve long since outgrown.

The previous incarnations of this website are similar. I don’t want to move them to this new site, so here they are on the Internet Archive.

The former [Yudhanjaya.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20221226095124/https://yudhanjaya.com/).

Largely useful for the journal entries (major milestones) and essays section. Put together, these are a sort of haphazard snapshot of my journey as a writer. I kept trying to make this a proper writer’s blog, with regular updates, and I never could be bothered to do anything more than a few posts a year; by this point the Wordpress format of blogs had begun to grate on me.

The [Icaruswept archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221226095802/https://yudhanjaya.com/author/icaruswept/).

The Icaruswept blog was how I first made a name for myself as a writer, writing steadily from 2010 until 2017 or so (some of the oldest posts may not exist in this archive). In one sense, it was very much an amateur soapbox - I’d ramble about anything and everything that caught my eye, and a lot of these thoughts are the voice of someone who feels alien and painfully newborn to me. On the other hand, this is where I began from, and much of my analysis - at least towards the end - led me down roads I walked later at LIRNEasia, at Watchdog, and with my nonfiction in general.
