I’m Yudhanjaya Wijeratne (@yudhanjaya), an SFF author, data scientist and researcher. I’m from Colombo, Sri Lanka. This website is my little online workspace.

For more information about me (and/or contact points), [go here](https://yudhanjaya.com/About-19b8a480e41740f9abbfb35ce7dafc3b?pvs=21).

For my portfolio - novels, short stories and games, [go here](https://yudhanjaya.com/Portfolio-a2d98a3e00cf4c9898a3e6568474088d?pvs=21). Each project contains a log of its creation.

I’m always working on several things at any given time. Sometimes these are tiny projects - sometimes they’re long, perpetual, possibly Sisyphean acts of tomfoolery. [This is what I’m working on right now.](https://yudhanjaya.com/Projects-570c4d8ac7164d768eb19a0cb95f4078?pvs=21)

If you arrived at this website from a link that no longer exists, what you’re looking for [may be here](https://yudhanjaya.com/Essays-Notes-Detritus-62468a1a5cd44908b65a4452801bd989?pvs=21).
