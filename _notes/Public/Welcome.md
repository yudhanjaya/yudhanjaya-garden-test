I’m Yudhanjaya Wijeratne (@yudhanjaya), an SFF author, data scientist and journalist. I’m from Colombo, Sri Lanka. This website is my little online workspace.

For more information about me (and/or contact points), go here -> [[About me]]

For my portfolio - novels, short stories and games, go here -> [[Portfolio]]

I’m always working on several things at any given time. Sometimes these are tiny projects - sometimes they’re long, perpetual, possibly Sisyphean acts of tomfoolery. This is what I'm working on right now -> [[Works in Progress]]

If you arrived at this website from a link that no longer exists, what you’re looking for may be here -> [[Detritus]]
