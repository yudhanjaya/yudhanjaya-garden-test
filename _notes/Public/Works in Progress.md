There are a few large projects that I feel compelled to document:
- [[The Earthbag Homestead]]
- [[Origami Meteorite]]
- The Wretched and the Damned
- [[The Salvage Crew]]
- [[The Commonwealth Empire Trilogy]]

Here's one where the documenting process is complete - I have nothing left to add.

- [[OSUN - The Poetry Machine]]

### 2023, September

- Finish porting yudhanjaya.com from Notion to Github
- Work on Salvage Crew 2
- Finalize configuration stuff on my computers - this includes upgrading main PC and setting up a low-power (<5W) writing setup. I need this to not waste power at the homestead.
- Check in and update on [[The Earthbag Homestead]]
