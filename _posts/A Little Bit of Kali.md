_It is 2023. The world is beset by an endless rain of kaiju flung into Earth’s gravity well. Their origin? A comet that crashed into the Moon, sprawled across its surface, and revealed itself to be an assembler of nightmares. Their target? The most populated centers of the Earth. And the only thing standing between us and them are the Shikari: ‘Hunters’. Giant cyborg machines hammered together in the nick of time, fashioned after the old gods of the Mahabharata, and sent out to do battle against the demons._

Where do old gods go to die?

Not to Mother Ganga, no. Not for us the fire that strips our sins from our bones, turns our bones into ashes, turns our ashes into a constellation of dust on the holy river. They say Ganga once took the seed from the fire-god Agni, which would have others burned this world to a cinder, and cooled it in her waters: but even she will not take our kind. Ganga only takes the flesh and blood. Leaves the metal behind.

They tried. The government of India lay one of us down in the waters - a prototype Vishnu, I think, '20, maybe '21. A thing too difficult to burn it, so they lit a ritual pyre and let Him slide into the waters. He lies there still, decades of human rot piling upon His frame. Sometimes His eyes light up, throwing mocking shadows at those who come to worship him from the dead river-banks, and those of us who know Him shudder, because underneath the ceaseless filth something still lives.

Some of us go to Moradabad. Uttar Pradesh. They say great mountains of body parts line the horizon. People walk here and there like crows, picking what they can and sending it to the government line. Others go to the Himalayas. They say the march - if you can still march - takes you to the Independent State of Tibet, where the monks, if you ask them kindly, will bless you and bury your head in the mountains. The snow cools the great engines, dulls the fingers, and freezes the mind: the slow sad suicide.

And afterwards the monks may return, to strip away your reactor core, send your body frame back to India, sell your CPU to China. Gods know why the Chinese keep buying CPUs, but the monks get to run their machine shops, the tourists get to take selfies, and both sides try not to invade a Tibet armed with dozens of nuclear cores. Everybody's happy.

But I happen to disagree. There is a third place. A secret place.

Cast your eye down. Down, past Telangana, past Andhra Pradesh. Walk past the beaches with their rotten sand. Past the roads lined stuffed with filth and saffron and the dreams of dead men. Past the vast tenements and battle-cannon of Madras. The government calls it Chennai, but who cares? The memories of this city outlast names, dates, petty councils. The Portuguese came here, then the Dutch, then the English, then the French, then the English again. One by one they were swallowed up by the noise, the color, the heat, the smell. They call this place the Detroit of India, but Detroit is a city of bunkers and skeletons.

Here, across crumbling roads, to the sea.

Walls. A dome that could be marble, if you don't look too closely. The first English fort built in India, named for St. George. The Tamil Nadu government used it before the invasion, but that changed when a demon landed too close for comfort. Bureaucrats are allergic to death, particularly their own. Arrangements were made in a hurry. The shoreline was declared unsafe. The fortress left behind.

Not that I could tell, the first time I care here. I saw the press of bodies outside, thousands thick, dressed in their finest. Saw electric lights snake between the trees, flickering in defiance. Saw the blood-oil on the old stone; the oil that they dipped their hands into, for luck, for a good show. Saw the stairs that separated us, sending the people to their seats, and us to the center, waiting for the death that comes in a shattering of steel and circuits.

This is the third, and last place.

This is where I came to die.

The colosseum, more in name and function than design, was a place of hard-packed dirt. It was of buildings promised but never to be. Their remains hung as skeletal frames looming over throngs of people too many to count. Old garden statues, hands gloved in moss, the feet coated with the patina of a million betel-leaves crushed, chewed and spat out. They gave way to monoliths of steel and electrical nerves. The empty shells of once-Shikari. They towered above all of us.

A first generation Vishnu, blue-hued, two hundred feet tall, with that Russian tank-gun attachment on one arm. They made only ten of those. On a good day two white lights crisscrossed over it, and you could see the three sigils of the government of India, the Tata logo, the sigil of Ambani metals on the breastplate.

Right opposite to it was a Shiva. It was hard to tell what line it came from: the Shiva series iterated fast and kept the same shell. Maybe the 13th gen, maybe the 16th. It sat as Shiva statues do - in the stance of a yogi, or one deep in meditation. Long metal locks fell back from the perfect forehead and the almost sorrowful phase. In the middle was the Third Eye, the LIDAR and tracking system that made the Shiva series so phenomenally accurate: I’ve seen my fair share of that graceful, deadly dance - a Shiva unlocking its Pinaka, the hand reconfiguring itself into the bow that smites all, the shoulders tensing, extending to three times their size, the arms launching arrow after arrow of guided missiles from which no enemy could run or escape. But here the Pinaka was missing. Instead someone had made a copy of the Trishula, the throwing trident; tried to mimic it right down to the stabilizer fins and the exhaust ports; and then mounted it rather awkwardly on Shiva’s crossed lap.

There was an irony to placing them here like this. On one hand, Vishnu, preserver; on the other Shiva, whose name comes from Sankrit, _śarv,_ “to kill”. Creator and destroyer. Vishnu’s avatar in the great epics was Krishna, who fought Shiva to a standstill - and yet the two were one and the same, complimentary parts of the same energy.

I paused among the stream of people threading their way between these two gods. I was here for my customary prayer. Nothing long, nothing exotic, just a brief touch. I need both on my side. People - faces- looked up at me, perhaps in awe, perhaps in confusion, wondering why a 40-foot metal giant paused with his hand on Shiva’s trident. Maybe they wanted to see me wield it.

I couldn’t.

Not all of us get to ride the Great Machines. Not all of us wake up as gods. Some of us have to be content with the cheaper, shittier versions, the same way that soldiers in war, stumbling about flat-footed, have to be content with being lesser than the tank. Not all of us get to claim a name like Vishnu. My suit was 38 ½ feet tall. I was sweating inside a steel cage inside. I was what the Army called an SRTS - Small-arms Reconnaissance Tactical Shikari - and what the rest of the world called a _microshikari_: a pale shadow of the original.

I was a pretender. I let my hand fall, let the crowd sweep me up - even a metal monster is no match for a Chennai crowd - and took my place among the other pretenders. We nodded to each other, and turned to watch the thing that now walked through the fighters’ arches.

This microshikari was shorter than most I’d seen. Cobbled together from damaged parts, no doubt, some shit salvaged from the Bay of Bengal; damned if the frame wasn’t a bit lopsided. The kind of stuff they sent to the scrap heap, only if you knew a guy who knew a guy who knew the right quartermaster or warehouse manager you could get a mismatched box, every so often, and it looked exactly like that, a patchwork metal Frankenstein. Like an old car screwed together from the dross from similar models, but different years. The chest…too broad, carrying clunky paneled armor bolted on with inelegant arms. Gaps in the panels, wide enough for a grown man to slip his hand through. Colors like a sandblasted lightshow. The face looked like it’d been punched in and hammered out again - almost Neanderthal in the right light; crude brow, jutting chin, iron bands welded on to toughen them. It was like looking at puppet sewn together from other discarded toys. And the mech hung from limp strings.

The eyes glowed a dull orange and stared at the crowd without seeing anything. As if they barely held and life and light inside them.

No god. Just a shell piloted by a man on the inside. Something soft—cowardly, pretending to be something greater.

_Greater._ Something I’d once aspired to be.

Thunder sounded in the near distance. I turned toward the source. In the passing glance, I caught sight of the crowd.

They scuttled about like bees—ants, busying themselves with the little intricacies that made the great stage work. Hands exchanged crumpled bills and slips of paper—names of mechs they expected to win. A blue-white glare pulled a few eyes toward it, standing out even under the brightness of the overhead lighting. A rake of a man thumbed over a tablet, likely recording transactions and bets placed. All crypto, of course, no traceable rupees here. The government forbade places like these, but micro economies had a way of happening whether the politicians wanted them to or not. Today there was serious money involved: I saw Bullet Vinay in his white coat, holding court before a murder of his thugs, sweating slightly in the heat. Bullet Vinay was a hard man, flush, not the type to step out for small cheese. Behind him, looking completely out of place and completely unperturbed by that fact, was Sonam, the actress. Fair, beautiful Sonam, the kind of woman they put on cosmetics advertisements to make dark-skinned girls feel bad. Vinay’s thugs were holding an informal cordon beyond her. Every so often a fan cried out, trying to climb over them, and she smiled indulgently as one of Vinay’s people dragged the poor victim off to a corner and gave him an autograph the old-fashioned way - brass knuckles to the face.

A translucent container passed by on a cart. Viscous sludge the color of a spider’s innards filled the cylinder, visibly shaking within.

My scanners still worked well enough to analyze the contents properly and display the results. **I couldn’t make out anything to identify which particular monster the gunk had come from, but I knew what it was valued at. The black market had high demand for any piece of our visitors from the stars. Messenger. Demon. Emissary. Hellspawn. Take your pick of names. The only message they brought was one of hatred and violence - one we answered in kind - and yet, here, as everywhere, people scuttled about bartering and scheming, and today Bullet Vinay would take the powdered nails, maybe the horn, in the belief that his waning libido would work as well as the pistol he kept tucked into his pants.

Mic Peter sauntered to the center of the arena. He carried his microphone in one hand, with a cord trailing far behind him. Stage lights gleamed off the bullet-shells embroidered into the tux he wore: I’d never seen the man without it. The rest of his features were lost. The lights took them. I knew what he looked like beneath the mask, of course, most of us did - a scrappy thing of knotted muscle and skin clinging to bone, barely worth looking at on the street, but here he was God.

“Varuga varuga!” Silence fell over the clarmor. “Right, ladies and gentlemen, sit-sit, the first event you have all been waiting for.” Peter threw out a hand decked with wires, pumping it at the mech I’d first taken in. “On my right, refabricated! Part Shiva, part Hanuman, a brawler—bruiser—you all know and love…” he tilted his head back and paused for effect. “The Chennai Blooooooodhoooound!”

The crowd erupted into raucous cheers that dwarfed the earlier sounds of thunder I’d heard.

Chennai Bloodhound stepped forward into the circular patch of dirt, arms upraised. Pumped one fist as if already declaring victory. It was a first-generation SRTS suit - bulky, wide rather than tall, designed for munitions and long-range support work. The crowd loved it; I tried not to notice how much of that fist was cracked and spot-welded. That was the toll here. The slow damage, the endless breaking of the body, the slow crumbling of all that you could be. The cost of glory—of one last chance to be a god.

“Annnnnnnnd—” the announcer waited till the noise died, putting one hand to his brow as if trying to peer off into the distance. “Coming to the arena on my left, a warrior you all know and fear. A legend on this stage! Arrey, solid Japanese steel and Tata engineering, and they say -” almost in a stage whisper, now, “with a few bits of Kali…”

He raised a hand, and the roar that accompanied it increased in volume, rising in a crescendo until the first throat broke ragged, and like the master that he was, Mic Peter kept them going, up and up and up -

_A few bits of Kali._

Peter didn’t know the meaning of what he spoke, or maybe he knew and didn’t care - I’d never been able to figure out that dog. Kali, the greatest and the most terrible Shikari series ever built; the six-armed goddess of destruction herself brought to wield her bloodlust and fire on those who would do us harm. Kali, the great, the magnificent, the doomed, because no Kali machine had ever escaped the descent into utter madness. It was their curse, the complexity of the Kali design, something about the human mind being unable to take the strain of a body map outside its own.

The Shiva design outside ran two arms, two legs. Shivas lasted a long time - enough to die of wounds as often as psychosis. The Vishnus, though not as stable, did the same: word was that they were figuring out how to add the other two arms but make them AI-powered, or maybe add a second pilot to the mix, so people wouldn’t be driven mad as fast. But the Kali design was pure poison - too many moving parts, too much raw power, too much for one human mind to handle. I had heard six months, nine on a particularly good pilot, and the ending was always violent.

“A shikari that has cut the competition into strips and ribbons . . .”

_A few bits of Kali._

**“A shikari that leaves nothing alive . . . arrey! I GIVE YOU THE BLADE OF RAJASTHAN!”

Thirty feet tall, even smaller than the Bloodhound. Blue, a blue so deep it was a shadow-black, polished to a fine gleam. Beautiful plate armor, the shape and musculature of a powerful athlete adorned in armor. Twin plumes of viridian for its eyes. Not a scratch, not a hint of damage. The eyes flickered and tracked rogue bits of movement in the crowd, drawing gasps here and there. This was a prime mech. Chennai Bloodhound, that old faithful, looked like a junkyard art project next to this.

One of its hands flexed. A chainblade burst from folds along its forearm. A copy of the weapon sprang forth from the other arm. It brought them together to form an X before its chest. The blades were the antithesis of the armor: ugly, pitted, scarred, it held the pose. More to play to the crowd than to intimidate Bloodhound. Then swiped - a single pose that shifted the metal feet, blurred the face, and turned the arms into a brief whirlwind of lethal metal. A single statue shook, decapitated.

The crowd roared. A bastardized display of Shikari strength, bravery, and all that made us—them—worth the awe and respect the world gave us. And the irony, of course, of taking that brute force and turning it into cheap cheap sport in places like this.

_You should be on the front lines,_ I told it silently. _You have no business here._

The Blade of Rajasthan stalked past, and now I could see. The scars, so cleverly painted over, where the original alloy had been replaced with cheaper scrap. The empty ammo ports. The gun-cowlings retrofitted and braced for those chainblades. That slight _lag_ that it hid so well with its theatrics. Yet another failure, no matter how well dressed.

The two mechs came to a few feet of each other, faces almost touching. There was a point between their gazes where the lights from their eyes almost meshed, losing the individual glow of their own to become something else.

Silence spread between the two mechs. The silence rolled out to the entire crowd. Mic Peter bent, mic now aside, spoke to the combatants. Even the lights had stopped their dazzling show, and now hung limp like a set of prismatic curtains. Sonam, the actress, leaned forward, and half a hundred leaned with her to see what had caught her eye. I knew what she was waiting for, of course - that one word to part the quiet, and the eruption that would follow.

“Fight!”

Both mechs exploded into action. Bloodhound snapped its head forward, bringing the sharp edges of its brow down toward the Blade of Rajasthan’s head. Score! Metal met with an impact that brought back the earlier thunder. Bits snapped off the black helm, glimmering in the light. Both mechs wobbled back, taking a step to regain their footing.

The Blade was the first to recover. The chainswords screamed as it drove its right fist toward Bloodhound’s torso. Bloodhound’s pilot parried - a pair of quick steps backward, a sweep of the arm, a fist driven directly into the Blade’s face - but the Blade was already moving; the left arm swung, the feint now obvious, and with a scream the Blade of Rajasthan twisted, dragging the sword across Bloodhound’s abdomen.

A shallow furrow crossed the multi-colored mech’s midsection. Hydraulic fluid spurted out from the gouge in pressurized mist.

_That’s the coolant gone._

“First blood!” thundered Mic Peter. “It is not the first time the Bloodhound has bled, no sir, no ma’am, but how long can a dog run without cooling? In this heat?”

Laughter. Bloodhound’s pilot brought both of the mech’s hands overhead, slamming them down like a hammer. Both fists crashed into the Blade’s shoulders.

I knew the force of those fists, as did the people in the stands. The blue-black mech buckled under the weight. The metal around its neck warped, like a tin can being crushed by a particularly malevolent child. Miniature mountains formed along the Blade of Rajasthan’s collar. A steel plate popped out. Others peaked to jagged edges. The Blade tackled wildly, going for Bloodhound’s left leg, and down they went, the screaming blades chewing away at Bloodhound’s arm. Bloodhound’s coolant sprayed in the Blade of Rajasthan’s face, somehow: the bladed mech staggered back, and Bloodhound responded - jab, jab, uppercut, right into the weaving black helm.

The crowd hooted and cheered. Music boomed from the speakers. The same goddamn ditty every time, Mic Peter ripping off some vaguely familiar song -

_No fear, I'm standing right here_

_Eyes peer, with my mind clear, never look rear_

_Only up, never down, off the ground_

_Till I'm found, hear the sound, listen to me now_

Imagine being reborn with all the grandeur and purpose of a god. To tower among all things man, monster, and made. To wield the power to shepherd the world…or destroy it.

_One shot, that's all you got_

_Take it right now, before you get lost, yeah_

And then broken, left to dance to a tuneless song of screams and raucous laughter. Crowd singing Youtube rap. And you, a once-gods playing for one last encore. Bits of Kali, indeed.

I turned away from the battle, knowing however it ended, two Shikari had still lost.

There was a time before this sordid affair, you know. Once I was a child, running through the hallways of my home, running after the colors of my mother’s sari. Then I was a young boy, proud of my grades, uncomfortable at how tall I was, at how bony my knuckles were, envious of easy riches of my friends. Then a man, filling in, learning the subtle art of making my way in a world that tolerated me only as long as I played by the rules.

It started and ended with my sister, of course. In my household, all things did. My sister was a couple of years older, the apple of my father’s eye. First thing she did after she came back from college in the US was to sign up for the Garud Commando - that elite Air Force unit, sent to fight behind enemy lines. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a Garud, but picture the American marines from the movies, under an Indian Air Force operation, add a whole lot of fanatic do-or-die on top, and that’s a Garud.

My sister’s batch was the first set of women allowed into the Garud, personally trained by Dr. Surbhi Rachoor - doctor, commando, CQC pioneer. At first they jeered - the politicians, the trainers, the other cadets - but where others saw a stupid mistake, my parents saw opportunity. My sister went through ninety weeks of training, up from the normal seventy-two. Agra for airborne training; then the Navy and Counter Insurgency for water and jungle operations; then survival training, with active missions thrown in almost as rewards. She came out a weapon; the perfect daughter, efficient, polite, and deadly – a national treasure.

I knew the world my family inhabited - the soft comforts, the apartments, the revolving drama of politicians and whose family owned what - in all these my sister was a prize card, the ultimate trump. Here was something money couldn’t buy. Something nobody else could have. From that moment on I was the lesser sibling.

Did my sister understand? I think she did. I was the one who got angry and wanted to make a difference. She was a pit viper. She weathered both with insurgents and my mothers’ marriage proposals with roughly the same attitude: kill them early, make sure they’re dead, move on. A casual cruelty there. She used to hum rap under her breath, committing light social atrocities to the sound of Eminem and whoever else she idolized that week.

In vain I tried to follow, to earn back some part of what I felt my family should have given their only son. I joined the forces, of course. My squad was sent to Ladakh - way up in the mountains, almost at the foot of the Himalayas. Word was a high-ranking Jaish-e-Mohammad warlord had gone to ground there - the Jaish had been running attacks since the early 2000s; now, hemmed in from all sides, this lot were trying to get to Aksai Chin, disputed ground between India and China. We had been sent in to finish the job. Picture a guillotine, if you will, dropping on a head from a great height: us, the blade, then, the unfortunate vertebra.

It was a beautiful country for a hunt. The valleys were of snow and stone -- white-capped mountains, and water so clean and pure, unlike anything in the cities further south. Within that, the Jaish, spread through the forest, panting and panicked - and us, cutting them down by the tens, the hundreds.

But then the apocalypse happened. The radios screamed at us to pull back and return immediately. Someone had attacked Mumbai. The city was on fire. Blood ran in the streets.

That was where I saw the first demon. An ugly, clumsy thing, like a child-larvae barely hatched, wobbling over its own broken limbs. The force of its descent had ruined millions. A spidercrack, an inferno, a crater in the heart of the city. We watched from helicopter gunships. And what should have been my first real mission - something that would have seen me decorated - was forgotten. Who gave a shit about some two-bit terrorists in Ladakh now? All of India turned around, angry, building for itself an anthem of steel. The _Shikari_.

Of course my sister volunteered. In vain I pleaded with her not to do it - the tech was too early, too untested, the program put together by a scrapheap bureaucracy. But passed with flying colors. Became one of the very first Kali, the first six-limbed goddess of destruction to score a major kill.

We were forbidden by law to initiate any contact, but that didn’t stop me from tracking her on behalf of the family. Her first kill was off Neo-Delhi, the one they called Tir. It had the face of a ram, and the body of a hound, with tentacles snaking along its back - a vast and bloated demon that gamboled in the clear waters and soiled them with its poison. Her second was a joint action; a smaller horde of demons attempting to take the land bridge between India and Sri Lanka. She worked with the Sri Lankan Hamuman mech on that mission - and carried it back in her arms when it went down. She was on every recruiting poster thereafter. Talk of the town. My parents were toasted, again and again, for producing the perfect child for the new age. Me, I was the dregs at the bottom of the barrel.

She died six months later. Officially, KIA. Off the coast of Goa. In reality, she had gone mad, slaughtered her entire support staff, laughed and shrieked as their blood and entrails pooled around her. And her last act was to somehow arrange to have the footage sent to both our parents and every single one of their little dinner circles. The who’s-who of Delhi woke up one day to see the talk of the town butchering six hundred civilians and dancing in their gore. There was one message waiting for me. A link to a song.

_One shot, that's all you got_

_Take it right now, before you get lost, yeah_

_One shot, that's all you got_

_Write your own story, you control the plot, yeah._

I listened to it over and over again, thinking I understood.

When I woke up the next day, GANESHA COMMAND had blacklisted our family and all our relatives, branded us for life as traitors. The day after that the banks pulled out of my father’s business ventures. And thus in her own way she broke us all. And every time I saw a Shikari striding across the horizon I flinched, knowing that that could be me. That should have been me…if not for my damned sister.

_Write your own story, you control the plot, yeah._

I don’t rightly know when the microshikari became a thing. People like Bullet Vinay (who I once shared a grand total of three drinks with) will tell you it was Tamil Nadu that started the whole process: wary of the central government having too much power, they set about building small scaled-down versions of the real thing. Suits of armor you could bolt on to a reasonably fit person, much more conventional weaponry. Strength in numbers. The official excuse was, of course, to help the local police special divisions handle the smaller demons that dropped every so often. Reduce the burden on India’s defenders. The real reason was that Tamil Nadu politicians wanted their own metal men. It was a show of force to the Delhi government. A pissing on the border line. Thus far and no further.

Me, I think that’s just one version of it. In India one event will spawn a hundred different stories and all of them will be true. I think what really happened was the bigger sharks in business - not the Silicon-Valley-of-India types, but the older breed - figured out that if you put a few guys in 30-foot metal suits on the docks you could run damn near anything into and out of a city. So they started looking for soldiers with nothing to lose.

I had nothing to lose. More importantly: I had nothing to gain. They had attached us to STS - Shikari Tactical Support. It was the closest I could be to those machines, so I took it, figuring I could at least participate, earn some glory; at least enough to sit down years later and tell tall tales of the day we marched alongside the gods.

What dreams. When Tir II landed in Kashmir they sent six squads of us out to deal with it, plus one Vishnu. Tir saw us coming: there is no subtlety with a Shikari. The plan was for Vishnu to distract it while we clawed out way up the sides, took out its eyes, dropped munitions down its throat, and let the wet thump and the chunks of alien flesh tell the rest of our tale. Didn’t happen. Vishnu went after that thing with a vengeance, and all we could do was stand on a damn valley lip and watch as the god battled the demon. The clunk-thump of Vishnu’s main cannon made our ears bleed. Tir II hit the ground bleeding and screaming and the impact shook the mountains. There was no place for us in that fight. We crawled back like ants. On the way our scans picked up a training camp, crushed flat beneath a single Shikari foot. The last of the Jaish in that area, I think; Vishnu had finished what we started.

There was no one incident, no great mistake. Instead there was sortie after sortie, mission after mission, and with each time we grew more and more useless. My squad went from being an anti-terrorism unit to a bunch of glorified mechanics. We had Jaipal, who we called Jumpy. His specialty was weapons. Kumar and Kabir - two identical twins, Indian mother, Sri Lankan father - they saw to armor and structure, testing frame stress, replacing hinges. We travelled as a crew, always hungry, always eager for our chance in the spotlight. Once I even got to see a Kali unleashed, ripping monsters apart with her bare hands, shrieking and breathing fire into the sea, and it was then that I really understood. There was no place for us anymore.

There’s a reason that all the epics name the heroes and the gods, but the people who fight and die for them are just nameless numbers. That was us. Just the bit players in the new Mahabharata.

I think in the end it was the warehouses that got to me. The endless darkness, stored away, yearning for a chance to be useful. The waiting. Then the sudden explosion - a brief chance to see the world outside, however dark; seconds to wonder at the lights, the cities, the demons themselves - and then back to camp we went, our usefulness ended. Sometimes we rode helicopters; sometimes there were armored cars to pick us up; but we were just janitors here. Our job was to set up the cordons, shout valiant greetings at the Shikari who brooded over us, and then fuck right off.

A kind of gloom took over me. A strange lethargy, wrapped around me like an iron hand; and yet around it a restlessness, a yearning for _something,_ anything. The world moved around me. I stood alone, exhausted, at its center. Had I been a shikari I could have done something, anything, but instead here I was, waiting in the darkness, listening to the slow cycling of engines.

First came the mental fog, that slow surrendering of thought. Then, two months later, worse; I was charged of breach of duty, because I apparently sat there and watched a Vishnu blow himself up and I did nothing. I couldn’t even remember the battle. A year down the line I could barely move. My lethargy was infinite. I wanted nothing.

My captain was an old man with that terrible comb-moustache and hard eyes. Rejected, he said, over and over again. No, the Shikari program didn’t need me. I had a job to do. And if I couldn’t.

“Before you cause . . . further embarrassment,” he said. “I can give you one last mission. Make it official. Have you wired up with a suicide vest. Do some good for the country.”

“No,” I said.

“You have no choice,” he said. “You are a soldier. In this army. In this war.”

“Then I quit,” I said. I’d never quit anything in my life before. It felt. . . strangely empty.

He gave me a blank, unreadable stare. “Return to your berth,” he said softly.

In the end, it was my father who came through. I don’t know how he did it: a phone call here, a favor there. All I know is that before dawn the next day, I was kicked out of my bunk, marched out of the hangar, right to the gates. The soldiers opened them; miles of broken land and scrub stretched out before us. My captain was just outside, a bent old man smoking a cigarette.

My status updated in my display. MIA, Missing in Action. Then my network access vanished.

“You’re not the first, you won’t be the last,” said the old man. “Useless soldiers make others around them useless. Go. Go now and die in whatever way seems best to you. I’ve given you every chance. Tell your father Mohan is done coddling his son.”

I can’t tell you how long I wandered. A failed soldier going home when India needed us the most. I knew I should have gotten back to my parents - but truth be told I couldn’t make myself go back. I ditched my gear, worked odd jobs, mostly bicycle repair. India is a country of motorcycles, and every village and every junction, those days, had a dusty little shop with a pile of half-rusted bikes outside and three grease-covered men inside screwing something onto and engine. I was one of those nuts. I worked in a two-bit town so nameless that you couldn’t find it on a map even if you wanted to.

One day a man brought in a bike I instantly recognized - a Royal Enfield Bullet. An ancient design, built to jump out of planes in the second World War, left to India when the British withdrew; now a stolid, reliable workhorse of a bike, one of the few capable of handling everything India could throw at it. I spent a bit more effort than I usually put into it.

The man who came to pick it up arrived in a long white Chrysler, kicking up fine dust. A floral print shirt stretched over an ample belly. Gold chains glistened on his neck. Two thugs got out with him - one swarthy and sweating in the heat, one pale and thin. Both wore white.

“Bad customer,” said the owner’s wife, and bustled out of there as fast as she could.

“So this is where my son ditched it, eh?” said the man with the gold chains, walking into the shop as if it were his. The owner cringed back. “Bullet? Black? That’s my property.”

This was Bullet Vinay. Named for his love of his Royal Enfields, though that I found out much later. I stood up from behind the bike - I’d been checking the spark plugs. The goons had fanned out. I knew I could take them if I wanted to.

A crowd was gathering outside. Bullet Vinay ambled to a halt in front of the bike.

“Hmm,” he said. “I was told the tank was cracked.”

“Fixed it, sir. New tank.”

“Silencer.”

“Also fixed, sir. No charge, sir.”

He finally shifted his gaze to me. Pale eyes. Lazy until they become intense. That’s Bullet Vinay. “The way you are standing,” he said. “You look like you want to hit Tiger here.”

Tiger was the swarthy man. “I don’t want to,” I said. “But if he moves any closer I will, sir.”

Bullet Vinay laughed. The laugh seemed to go on forever. “Military man? Arrey, don’t tell me. You’ve done a good job on the bike. Violence, get it out of here.”

The pale man moved forward, flicked me a smile, trundled the bike out of there. Bullet Vinay took off one of his chain slowly, ponderously, and with the air of an emperor giving a lordship to a lesser servant, he put it on the counter.

“Military man,” he said, shuffling his vast bulk around. “When you want to make some real money, come see me. Bullet Vinay appreciates fighting men.”

We watched the white Chrysler ride out of that dusty town. And behind it, purring smoothly, the Enfield Bullet.

That was how I ended up in Chennai.

Bullet Vinay ran a tidy operation. He was one of those people who Got Things Done. He worked for a local politician, doing the stuff that kept the campaign money going. The government had granted him - not in so many words, but wink, wink, nudge, nudge - three SRTS suits, second-generation discards from the special forces, as “bodyguards” - because in times of war you protected the people who Got Things Done. Bullet Vinay, in turn, made damn good use of the suits. Tiger, the swarthy man, operated one. Naan Violence - Kumar on the streets, but he really wanted to be called Naan Violence - piloted the other suit. By day they ran construction - nothing like an untiring 40-foot laborer doing the dirty work on a building for you, with the cops grinning and diverting the endlessly aggressive traffic around them. By night they ran “logistics”. Foreign currency, smuggled electronics, gold - a tidy little operation. Which left a third suit free.

“We’re in the South, yar,” Violence said by way of explanation. “Who cares about the whims and wishes of a bunch of suits in Delhi? Tamil Nadu is its own beast. This is the right way to live, you know. If you play your cards right, do a bit of bargaining, you’re good, they’re good, everyone lives. Someone seems upset, you offer to talk to them -”

Tiger snorted. “Like the time you offered to sit on the mayor’s house?”

“All a part of the bargain, my friend. They all know the dance, know the outcome. This is just ritualized behavior, you know. Somewhere in the middle you meet, everyone’s slightly unhappy, and that’s when you know you have a good deal.”

“They keep threatening to call in a proper Shikari,” said Tiger.

“Nonsense. This is a city of ten million people, yar. The collateral damage will be huge. Enormous. Million dead. Very bad political optics. Besides, any Big One will get stuck in the damn river and we’ll end up charging extra to pull it out. They threaten, I offer to do up the municipal bunker for free, we go back to the way things were. Rituals, my friend, rituals.”

And so on and so forth. Until one day, Mic Peter arrived. The limping cord of a man bent Bullet Vinay’s ear. There was big money in fights, he whispered. The film stars, the social scene, they really want some action. There were people willing to invest. Paint us in their colors, have us dance a bit - a few wins, enough to buy new suits, yes, there was plenty of scrap coming down the system now, enough to wire together anything Bullet Vinay wanted.

Mic Peter’s operation drew a crowd, at least three new microshikari a month - some of them defectors; some from operations like Vinay’s; some replicas paid for by some Bollywood stars. They gave us names, painted us, built little local legends around us. I became Kubera, named for the god of wealth, one of the semi-divine yakshas who protected the world. Tiger was painted in the Tamil Eelam colors - they gave him the sigils of the LTTE, the terrorists who had fought in Sri Lanka for so long, made up a story about him being the last LTTE fighter. Only Violence kept him silliness, a pasty white microshikari that brought a bouquet of orchids to every fight.

There was a line of sorts in Mic Peter’s operation. Tiger was the first to go, crushed under a second-generation suit - roughly my line, but with some hook-and-claw modifications I didn’t recognize. That pilot was mad, its battle-cry a stream of endless curses and screams, its armor painted the violent red and green of energy drinks. Violence was up next, and he taunted that bastard until it made a mistake and Violence snapped his neck and staked him to the ground with what was left of a lamppost. Violence went down a month after that to some Nepali Gurkha - long-knife, third-generation suit and all.

And Mic Peter made millions, a good chunk of that sent straight to Bullet Vinay, who dutifully purchased the latest SRTS suits from the police and bought new warm bodies to fill them. While, we walked among the crowds; we let ourselves be touched and worshipped, cursed and praised, and died.

And I got my chance at godhood.

Little things like oil changes and hydraulics have, indeed, crept up on me. My engine sputters once every 713 cycles. My left shoulder throws sometimes. My sensors are not what they used to be. But in a land of dead things, I am alive, more alive than I’ve ever been.

Ah, sister, if you could see me now.

In the ring, Chennai Bloodhound reeled. Its front looked as if someone has flayed it. The wide gash across its belly had stopped leaking - no more coolant left to spray. Its left arm was gone - the shoulder was all that remained, and in the center a red, tangled mass of wire.. The Blade of Rajasthan had been methodical.

The Blade itself had done well, surprisingly. Its face was a dented ruin: Bloodhound went for the head. The back had taken a pounding, and the right leg smoked a bit - servomotors burning, I think. But it was alive, and waiting.

A thin scream escaped the helm as the Bloodhound gripped the ring. Then it cut off and Bloodhound pushed itself upright one last time, stuttering - motors giving out, the load too much. A thick red ichor seeped out slowly around the broken hinges and the chest cuts.

The crowd held its breath. An un-Chennai silence. The Bloodhound, the crowd favourite, the scrapper we had come to know and love, bowed and quaking before the blue-black menace with the scarred chainsword. The Bloodhound seemed to nod - a small movement, almost indistinguishable from the motor shakes, unless you knew what to look for.

The Blade of Rajasthan blurred, extending itself in one perfect thrust, impaling Chennai Bloodhound. Chainswords ripped through the plate, through the metal beneath, bursting from the back.

The crowd erupted. Cheers; wails; fake flower petals fell from the ceiling in their millions; a band started playing, the lights strobed, and Mic Peter scrambled into the ring, screaming with the rest of them. Bullet Vinay was gesturing angrily at a man in a dark suit; no doubt he had good money on the Bloodhound. Sonam had strolled right down, just in front of the ring, posing for an assistant who tried to beat back the crowd and take a photo of her at the same time. I stood up and made my way to the back.

The seats and the crowds were only the front of the operation. Behind the stage there was courtyard, filled with emergency techs and shikarwallahs squatting and smoking the humid night away. Beyond them, a string of garages. Well, really old buildings that had once probably belonged to some fat government dignitary or the other, but when Peter’s people took over this place they stripped out the wood and windows and added poured concrete and steel cross-bracing.

Chennai Bloodhound came in through the courtyard on a trolley pulled by ten men. Muscles strained in the night. The shikariwallahs threw their cigarettes aside and lunged forward, grinning. The techs jabbered and argued. Bloodhound’s parts would never make to the garage.

I pushed them aside. One or two quick flicks, enough to crush a bone or three. The humans hung back, sullen and passive.

I looked at the thing on the cart. Bloodhound was dying. They knew it, I knew it. The arms hung useless. The helm was broken: shattered skin and a broken face lay underneath. The chest leaked machine oil and blood.

“He’s good,” said Bloodhound. “Bloody good. Angry fucker.”

“I know.”

“Ah. New people. I was in Assam Rifles.” One of the oldest paramilitaries in India, formed by the British in 1835, renamed, sent off to both World Wars, later deployed on the Myanmar border and in Sri Lanka. A storied legion.

I pushed the trolley to its garage. Other metal hands joined me. White hands, white body. The mech called Channa - a generation ahead of mine, or maybe a variant, slender and with a sniper rifle mounted on the back. Channa never spoke, never fought in the ring: she was Vinay’s latest, and ran security for Peter.

“My name,” said Bloodhound wearily and we pushed him across the humid night.

“You have family?”

“No,” said Bloodhound, and shook. “I can’t remember my name.” A sigh. “I can hear the sea outside.”

We pushed him into his garage, a sad, empty space full of power tools and space parts. Channa looked at me, nodded, and went off to wherever his rounds took him, as graceful as a cat in the night.

“This is it, then?”

“This is it,” I said.

Bloodhound tried to raise a hand. “Your fight tomorrow?”

“Yes, sir.”

It grunted. “Watch out for that sword. Keep your eyes on his shoulders. He leads with his left.”

“I will, sir,” I said.

And Chennai Bloodhound died. I watched the life drain from its eyes. And then it was just a pile of scrap and junk fashioned in the shape of a man - a crude Frankenstein. The throng of wallahs crept closer, cutting torches in hand. Flames, small and lively, sputtering at the ends of their tools. Insects come to claim the remains of Bloodhound.

Channa put a hand on my shoulder. A shake of the head. No, not our fight. So we watched them from the corner. They sang, these insects, some laughed, as they took fire to steel. The whole of it took place like an old ritual. The plates carted off, carefully; most of them would show up at Bullet Vinay’s house. The head - no, that would be a trophy. The engine - whoever scraped the blood and guts off it would see it to some autoshop nearby.

Ah, sister, see what we have become. The dream bastardized. No glory, save for that moment in the circle.

_Would that be me?_

What else could await me but that now? After all. This was Chennai.

Back at the colosseum, Mic Peter stood ready to announce the next bout. The crowd had settled a bit. Bets had been resolved, a few fights outside, the appetizer had come and gone. Now they salivated for something more. Chennai didn’t run on just one fight. No, there was more.

Me.

Peter had spun a legend around me, of course. I was an elite commando, he said, last of my squad, sent out to single-handedly take down a demon. So badly damaged in the fight I crawled into an SRTS suit, and from then on lived like one of the Shikari themselves. What bullshit. I’d never had to terrorize anything more than a few armed thugs. I’d taken more damage from all the idli I ate. I was a fucking washout, a painted face, lipstick on a pig.

But the crowd cheered. They stamped their feet. They wanted to see me. Wanted to see what the training and sacrifice of mine offered them as a spectacle. Not of the gods, but close enough for government work, as Vinay always said.

The music pounded, hard and fast. _One shot, that's all you got_

_Take it right now, before you get lost, yeah_

_One shot, that's all you got_

_Write your own story, you control the plot, yeah -_

The ring had been reassembled faster than I would have thought possible for the crews here. A massive cage of steel wire and bars ran around the arena, standing higher than what even a Shikari-full could reach. My sensors registered a low but persistent current running through the construct. It wouldn’t do much to me. So why was it there?

Mic Peter took the stage. The lights all died save for one, carrying the soft subtle glow of pale moonlight. It filtered through a few levels of intensity before settling on the right strength. The beam centered itself on Peter as he brought the microphone to his mouth.

“Arrey, arrey! How about that fight with Chennai Bloodhound and the Blade of Rajasthan, ah? Ah!” He waited for the crowd’s response, going as far as putting a cupped hand to one of his ears. Mic Peter knew the applause would come.

And it did, like a drubbed storm - beaten into life from stomping thunder and hailstorm clapping.

Mic Peter played to them, waving in arm, motioning for them to be louder. Loud enough that the world outside Chennai would hear her cries for attention this night. They gave it to him before he cut them off like a conductor. A simple slash of his hand and it all died.

Silence. He held onto it, toying with us all. He knew anticipation for the main event would only build the longer he stretched it, molded it into an unease and curiosity that would have the most patient of stones rocking back and forth.

Once I felt the blanket of quiet couldn’t hold up any longer, couldn’t smother the anticipation of the crowd, he ripped it free with a grandeur and smoothness only he could command.

“Tonight’s main event is on us. No refabbed dolls now - oh-no! No bits and pieces of Shikari. No! You don’t want toys now, do you?” He repeated the question, louder, turning in place to stare at the crowd.

They screamed their response, their excitement at wanting something more. Something grander.

“Arrey! You want a battle of gods and monsters*?* You want what spectacles light up your cell phones and television screens? You want Shikari and demons! You want the Bay of Bengal, horror and excitement! Monsters and gods here in Chennai tonight!”

In another moment, another time - a human one - I could have appreciated Mic Peter’s crowd control. But there was a loud clank, and the fighter’s arch opened. The Blade of Rajasthan stumbled out. His fists clutching a tight bundle of chains that led into the darkness. A savage yank pulled him back. He pulled back, the chains snapped tight, and something screamed from the pit.

I tensed.

Clank.

A step. Blade of Rajasthan tugged. Again. The outline of a jaw, teeth that gnashed, tongues that forked -

Clank.

And the demon unfolded from the darkness.

I swear I jumped to my feet, shouting. We all did. Alarm; panic; a scream at the front and the audience fought to get away. Sonam, the actress, rushed past me, her bodyguards bouncing off my plate as one by one they tried to push me aside on instinct and realized what exactly they were trying to brush aside.

“SIT DOWN!” thundered Mic Peter, cutting through the noise like a whip.

By all the gods, a real, live demon. Starspawn. An actual alien, moon-born enemy, chained, trussed, brought _here._ So _this_ was Mic Peter’s gambit. The man’s ambition truly knew no bounds. As the thousands of phones came out of the audience, I realized that the social media shares on this alone would double the crowd next month, nay, triple it, with Bullet Vinay smiling all the way to the bank. Now I realized what the electrified cage was for.

“BEHOLD!” thundered Mic Peter, his voice rising to a fever pitch. “Look upon your enemy, eh! Look upon _our_ enemy! Look upon those who would take our world from us! Our damnation - our malediction, Phatakaar!”

And then I saw what I should have seen right at the start. This demon was crippled, barely fifty feet tall, a bizarre cross between lobster and arachnid. Far too many legs across a body tapered too thin to handle them. A grotesque set of mandibles that overlapped oddly, almost as if they had been an afterthought more than part of its original design. They rattled against one another, their alignment leaving them to grate violently. Each of its legs visibly quaked under its awkwardly distributed weight. Its carapace carried the dull coloring of worn and unpolished onyx, still managing a subtle shine when it caught scant bits of the arena lighting.

It was a giant, yes, but not one of the terrible giants that the real Shikari battled. Its lunges at Blade of Rajasthan were less a predator’s leap and more like shackled hobbles. Rajasthan hauled it, straining right to the edge of the case.

“But,” came Mic Peter’s voice from the speakers around me. “In every age, in every legend, India has had its protectors. Every time the demons came our heroes came forth, too, striding out legend - STRIDING, I say - to do battle. And! Tonight! Ladies! And Gentlemen! I give you! Our hero!”

The light snapped on me, blinding. The audience washed out in that glare. All I could see was the demon; Channa had joined the Blade of Rajasthan, and together, white mech and black manhandled the alien into the ring, cut the chain. It unfurled its extra limbs, those I hadn’t noticed properly.

Pincers, armored in chitin, stretched out from the center of its chest. Free of the chains, they snapped at thin air. I saw the creature’s eyes swivel, focusing on the crab-like appendages almost as if it had forgotten them. It gnashed its off-center mandible again. I saw rows of serrated teeth, all sprouting at wrong angles like a chainsaw blade off its guide bar. Now that was troubling.

A Misprint. The bastardized crosses in designs our enemies on the moon sometimes made. We don’t know what fuckery they used to make those demons, but every so often they churned out things like these - design experiments, maybe, hybrids between individual creature platforms that worked well enough in nature when left alone. Mixed, they presented problems. The failed prints were still dropped into our oceans as fodder. Some were unable to survive the rigors of the drops or strength of ocean swells. They died as soon as they met our waters. A shame this one hadn’t.

There was a certain symmetry to this. A small demon, a runt. Versus me. The runt of our family in a line that stretched to Kali. Gods versus monsters, played out in the perfect microcosm. And audience waiting, captive in heart and mind. The answer of who would triumph between us.

A hollow dread filled me. I stood up. I barely heard Mic Peter’s rehearsed monologue as he chanted the terrible sins of this demon. Buildings torn down, aye, people ripped from homes, children cut down where they stood, blood in its wake. I focused on getting down there. One step. Two. People threw flowers at me; garlands. I batted them aside. Sonam’s bodyguards, again caught in my path in the actress’s constant migration around the stage. One of them put a hand on me, made a fist, cheered. The music blared.

_As the beat pounds every ounce_

_Of my effort pouring out, so you never have a doubt_

_Do you like me now? Am I good enough now?_

_Should I get more loud, till you hear the fucking sound?_

Backstage. The yard. The wallahs staring at me with their curious eyes. The arch that led to the underchamber that led to the stage.

Beyond, I could see the ring, lit up; Mic Peter, outside, working himself up into that fine edge of manic and statesmanlike gravitas that defined a match; the crowd on their feet, roaring and hissing at the demon that prowled, snarling, in the cage -

In the cage meant for me. I entered, knowing that once it shut behind me, only one of us would leave alive…

At best.

“ROUND ONE! FIGHT!”

I surged first. Micro or not, the only way out of this was to come down like the old gods in the Mahabharata. Steel and thunder. I sent a heavy fist toward the center of its knife-lined maw, putting every ton of my weight behind the blow. The strike connected and chitin cracked around the monster’s mouth. Teeth split and enamel shattered as the beast staggered to one side.

Phatakaar. So much for that. It crashed to one side, legs scrambling beneath its elongated body in hopes of righting itself. The crowd chanted. I closed in, intending to kick this frail and pathetic excuse into the ground.

Phatakaar lashed out with two claws, swinging them like crude cudgels. Fast! So fast! Their bulk struck the side of my left leg and took the strength from me. I toppled to one knee as Phatakaar followed up with a succession of clubbing bows. The remaining pair of pincers slammed into the broad of my back, trying to bring me fully to the ground.

I planted my hands against dirt and stone. Synapses burned, my mind churned, and the whole of me pressed against the earth to drive me back and away from Phatakaar. I rose to a stand and pivoted, bringing an elbow down between the demon’s twin stalks.

The base of my armored joint struck home and cracked a portion of carapace like a jackhammer on concrete. It split, spider-webbing with cracks over a distance as large as both of my palms. Phatakaar wobbled in place. Stunned? Good. I intended to do far worse to it. I twisted at the hip, striking again for that break.

At the last second, it seemed, the creature regained a semblance of clarity, in the space my attack moved, closing the gap between us, taking the brunt of my attack against one of its pincers. The remaining three weaponed limbs crashed against my torso and hip like flails. Each of them hammered me like stones on a sheet of glass ready to give away. I pivoted away; beat it back. The limbs crashed on me, relentless. I buckled. Down. Down to my knees.

I barely swatted the next two strikes away, before the other pincer came, sending me staggering backwards.

The bell rang.

The cage opened. Two shapes, moving at lightning speed. Blade of Rajasthan and Channa, the white Shikari, rushed to restrain Phatakaar. Electrified chains once again bound the Misprint of a demon as it was pinned and fastened within the arena. Phatakaar shrieked in electrified agony.

I barely noticed. I reeled back, stumbling, through the darkness of the fighter’s arches, far. From the clamoring and screams. From Phatakaar and the screams of the crowd. Bits of me pounded in confusion. A hammering that belonged in a man, not a shikari.

That was not how it should have gone. Gods versus monsters played out in the smallest of form factors. It should have ended then and there. Microshikari, broken and refabricated, echoes of old gods, triumphant over a Misprint. I should have won.

Fuck. My thoughts scattered. Bullet Vinay’s mechanics swarmed across me. An almighty banging ensued.

I’m telling you: something else drove me that night. Perhaps Shiva smiled down upon me. Or perhaps Vishnu did. Or perhaps the pieces of me that were supposed to be shikari spurred me back to the ring.

Mic Peter didn’t waste time with theatrics. He sliced upward with a hand, cutting through the air and noise with that singular motion. Everything went silent. And down came the hand.

Round two.

I exploded into the cage just as Phatakaar’s chains fell free. The impact of our crash shattered more of Phatakaar’s carapace, leaving me free to wound it further. I stiffened the fingers of my right hand into something like a crude shovel, plunging it through the crack with as much force as I could muster.

Phatakaar’s core opened up like the shell of an egg. Inside was the softness, the weakness within. Before I could reach any deeper, getting to the heart of the monstrosity, it bucked and pulled away from me, visibly bleeding, great gouts of gore splattering the ring. In sheer, blind panic, it seemed, it struck, as if seeking to bury me under the sheer flurry of maddening blows and their weight.

And it worked.

The first pass sent electrostatic bursts through my vision. Seconds later, I realized my cameras were off; perspective skewed. Input lag kicked in. Phatakaar washed over me with another series of clubbing attacks. A distant scrawl of data informed me more of my sensors had faltered. My left shoulder now registered as shattered - useless. No amount of commands would reach it.

I staggered to one side once again. Arm up. Arm up. In case the Misprint try to bludgeon me as I recovered. I had acted in haste, like an idiot. I batted my good hand at the demo. Jab, jab - if I could get one good fist in there -

I failed.

It reached out, taking my limp arm at the bicep between one of its pincers. The claw shut, hard. It dug into the metal of me.

I screamed - a primal thing that the crowd heard, responded to. I planted my feet and yanked, trying to disrupt its footing and smash my free fist into its face. Its weight tumbled away from me, but its grip never faltered. More of my arm crumbled under its pressure. It hit me again, and again, that unbalanced body unpredictable.

A savage fury of sparks, my sensors giving out. One more pass of blows from Phatakaar. ****I reeled, suddenly unable to breathe. Visor. Visor. The cue must have been given for the round end, because metal hands - Channa - yanked the demon away from me, and I was left shuddering and stumbling backwards. Flipped my visor up. Gulped air. The roar. The crowd screamed. The speakers, horribly distorted, spat out their poison beat –

_Oh no, I'm losing my shit again_

_Having a fit again, man, I'm forgetting when_

_I used to have some friends, I used to play pretend –_

Visor down again. Better the darkness than the noise. I was on my knees. Where? Edge of the ring. The arches beckoned. The repair crew. A dark shape loomed through the haze. It was Blade of Rajasthan. His violet eyes glared at me. A focus point; I snapped to, the blurred crowd traded away. This close I could see every scratch on that helm - every inch of the punishment Bloodhound had meted out before he died.

A hand clanked onto my shoulder. I stiffened. Rajasthan. I leaned on him. My arm, my actual flesh arm, I was sure, was pulped, mangled beyond recognition. I was being half-lifted, half-dragged to the edge, into the darkness, away from the noise. Hands reached for me, cutting torches - no, I batted them away. My suit was broken. The crew retreated.

Something slapped me. Hard. I tasted blood in my mouth.

“Your sister says to stop running,” said Rajasthan, locking violent eyes with me. It had a strange voice: guttural, but I couldn’t place it.

“_What did you say?_”

“Your sister,” said Rajasthan. “Your sister. Your sister. Your - your - your -” it stuck, like a broken robot caricature. The violet eyes dimmed. Then something rebooted inside: I heard it whine upward. “Time’s up. Go show them what you are. Or what you aren’t.”

My one good hand must have been like a vice grip, because I pulled Rajasthan bodily towards me. “Show yourself,” I hissed at it. “Show yourself!”

Lag. The violet eyes flickered. Then Rajasthan pushed me away and turned around, hunched, the back plates sliding apart. To show the pilot’s harness.

Empty. No human arms in that frame. Instead a red-tinged hulk of metal, all lines and circuits. Parts of it badly cracked; other parts looking like they’d melted and run to slag. But at the core, that unflinching red dot. I knew what it was. And, judging by the faces of the mechanics around me, they did, too.

A Kali core. One of the thirteen processor units that housed a Kali personality. Gods help us, someone had wired it into a SRTS suit. _A little bit of Kali._ Bloody hell. Mic Peter hadn’t been kidding.

Rajasthan turned around. A forty-foot machine of war, violet eyes glimmering in the darkness.

“How? You - you went mad -”

“Madness runs in the blood.” The Blade of Rajasthan froze again. Again that reboot. Again that upcycle. Outside, the speakers blared.

I tried lifting my arms. One responded. The other didn’t. I could no longer feel it.

“One shot, that's all you got,” Blade of Rajasthan hummed, the harsh voice holding perfect time to the speakers outside. And then it clicked.

The old song, her last message to me. The head tilted. One arm lifted. Pointed at the stage. The roar of the crowd hid the words, but I didn’t have to hear Rajasthan to know what it was saying.

_One shot, that's all you got_

_Write your own story, you control the plot, yeah._

Phataakar shrieked, thrashing, attacking the cage. A Misprint. A mistake. Versus me. The misprint. The mistake.

I staggered. Put up my one good fist. And stepped forward again, into the light.
