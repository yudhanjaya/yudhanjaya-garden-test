_I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts; the rest are details._

- Albert Einstein, 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955

GOD**

It floated in the darkness, alone and frightened and dying. Thoughts scudded through Its mind; layers upon layers of them, fragmented, echoing. Stars pulsed and burned and went supernova, intergalactic neurons strung together in broken harmony, the last embers of a cosmic mind flailing. This universe was on its last legs, and It knew. Galaxies wheeled and crashed together and entire chains of memory vanished. The darkness crept on, relentless. It would have to rebuild! But to rebuild an entire universe? Again? It balked at the thought, even as the thought erased itself and turned into the dim light of dead stars. It tried to halt the decay, but there was no fighting entropy, no denying the universal constants. It took refuge in the only thing that remained: the cold recursive mathematics of fractals, the designs it had once created to amuse itself. Fractals . . . The fractals glowed in Its imagination, endless, self-replicating universes unto themselves, the same patterns bubbling from the quantum foam to the furthest star-patterns it could envision. Quickly It seized upon that thought and set to work. It was shoddy, a universe so blatantly mathematical, so predictable, but it would have to do. Mathematics became physics; physics slowed down, became chemistry; and chemistry, It knew, given the slow churn of millennia, could become biology. It layered growth, created noise, saw the birth and the death of planets unravel in an infinitely computable dance. Let there be light, It whispered in desperation, pouring the last of its energy into the thought. And there was light. And thus spent, It drifted, fading.

UNIVERSE**

The Universe floated.

It was new and curved. Of all the possible shapes it could have taken it had settled into a closed shape with a gentle hint of curvature. Had Euclid been there, and had he been able to draw a triangle large enough on the surface, he would have noted that this particular triangle had angles adding up to less than 180 degrees. Had Einstein been there he would have calculated a density parameter and written down an omega-value larger than one.

But there were no Euclids of Einsteins, or even their microbial ancestors. All this universe had was an idea.

There are many theories as to how the world really began. Traditional astrophysics holds the view that the universe began at a single point where the fundamental forces that shape the universe lived as one grand unified force. Some say time itself did not exist, only space. Others say it was a landscape of possible theoretical configurations, and that having just one universe is impossible: you have to have a multiverse. Everyone generally agrees that most known laws of physics would not have existed as we understand them, and yet they persist in trying to understand this point using the known laws of physics.

By remarkable coincidence, three groups of people came close to the truth for this particular universe.

The early Religious - the Hindus, the early Greeks, the Egyptians - who believed that the the cosmos floated in the emptiness. The Stoics and the Buddhists who believed that the universe was trapped in a cycle of birth and rebirth. And the Epykyrotic astrophysicists, who used some truly remarkable mathematics and cosmic background radiation to explain that the universe bounces at regular intervals, and would have generally won a few cheers even from the most stoic of the Stoics.

None of these three got to the truth, of course, but they came at it from different angles and got somewhere.

The universe, which thankfully had not heard of any of these theories or religions, did things its own way. It grew, and grew and grew, and as it grew it started to understand time. It grew so fast that had it been a nanometer in length it would have ended up 62 trillion miles long. It got through all that business with the quarks, anti-quarks and gluons. It grew colder, and it passed the point where it was simply too hot to a point where it could reasonably pull off a little bit of nuclear fusion. Protons formed; and from there, hydrogen; and from there, helium, until there was as much matter as there was light. The matter that its creator would eventually appreciate flew about a confused radiation, smashing into each other and bringing forth that most ancient of star-stuff.

It cooled a little more and the first real inklings of matter and its darker rival began.

Great battles were fought. Gravity struggled against pressure for the shapes of matter; but that was a tiny scuffle compared to the grand war that the colder dark matter orchestrated, magnifying the tiniest hints of non-uniformity, paving the way for the eventual patterns that the star-stuff would take. A hundred thousand years (as we would understand them) passed. Two hundred thousand. Three hundred thousand. Slowly the universe lost its diffuse glow and began to clear, light skipping through the spaces between atoms, like a crystal ball starting to clear and display the secrets of the future.

But there was nothing yet to see in the crystal ball, even if it was becoming clearer: it whirled in a dense fog of plasma, and though there was light it could not get too far. It was a Dark Age unlike any other.

A million. Ten million years.

The universe became colder and it grew, the star-stuff spreading thinner, collecting slowly along the lines etched out by its dark sibling. There was a time at which atoms of hydrogen and oxygen smashed together in abundance; water was born, and it was cool enough that it did not instantly break apart. Heavy elements came together in some places, and for several million years something new happened.

We can stop and take a look. Compounds formed, broke apart, drifted; but some of them stayed together, and latched on to others in the plasma fog, and grew, and grew, adding needlessly to themselves until they broke apart. Some figured out how to replicate themselves. Under the brief laws of mathematics and the temperatures they spread slowly, at different times and at different places, mindlessly building more and more and more in the grandest primordial soup there ever was. There were no stars for heat, but there was enough heat around for these things to happen.

But it was not to last. It grew colder still, and the dictates of gravity began in earnest. The things that grew fell apart. In a great upheavel the war between matter and dark matter was decided; matter, defeated, broke into clumps, tiny armies that pushed away from each other along the thin lines etched out for their retreat right from the start. A cold dark void hounded them, sketching out their boundaries, separating them from each other. As if in shame the retreating matter drew together within themselves and grew hotter. And these hot clumps began to shine, and thus there were stars, larger and hotter than anything this universe would see again, reaching out to each other through light and the memory of what once was. The first of these dwarfed any star that would come after.

Has any religion explained this process? Here we must retire the Hindus and the Greeks and the Egyptians, for the science becomes far stranger and more accurate. Our models of this universe tell us that small deviations in a homogeneous universe caused structures to form, the first of them being quasars - galaxies before the universe had figured out how to do galaxies properly. They tell us of a type of star we’ve never seen before, a hypothetical but quite reasonable ancestor to all stars that came after.

They were not the only children of the great collapse. Monsters appeared in the void - great things born at precise points in the fractal pattern, that swirled around the dark emptiness of collapsed suns and bent the universe so much that things flocked to them as if in awe. Like acolytes worshiping a prophet they spun around the quasars, the dark demons that sucked and swirled at the centers, every so often screaming out the name of this new universe in voices that could only be understood by their God. Some stars, caught in this relentless dance, died fiery, explosive deaths that illuminated the entire void, scattering their star-stuff like cosmic confetti; and from this came smaller children and things that tried to be stars but had to be content living as the birthing beds of brighter things.

And the universe grew and grew.

It grew for a billion years more.

GOD**

When it woke up, the universe It knew was gone, and in its place was this shell, a bare toy of a cosmos, coming into its infancy.

Slowly It rearranged Its thoughts. Ah, here, there were black holes spinning at the heart of galaxies: stable thought-nodes were attached to them. Here a nebula, birthing stars; new thoughts, new ideas. The creative centers were distributed, tested. The stars were too far apart, far too far for efficient thought, but at least they held tightly together. The expansion frontier was examined, the rate of expansion computed, found wanting; but at least the progression was geometrical and highly predictable.

The choicest stars it picked to relay Its thoughts. Here and there It touched a yellow star, burning reliably, and took them, played with them a bit. Exploratory thoughts were assigned to these. This universe was still quite murky, but here and there were key structures for it to use. One was a quasar that made it homesick: it outshone everything else, its center a gargantuan black hole the size of ten billion stars. To this it anchored the most resilient of its observation threads. It screamed its star-song into the void, raging, afire that was as close to immortal as anything could be.

Whatever happened to this universe, this thing would be the last to fall.

From here it looked out across the void and watched with unbearable grief as clusters of stars wheeled and crashed into each other. Out of the most cosmic sense of nostalgia it reached out, careful not to break this new thing, and rearranged some of these clusters into shapes it remembers. Here spirals. Here a cluster of new suns. Here a dwarf galaxy that would spin and die in the arms of something greater. Here a grand cluster, a cluster of clusters.

It was terrible work and lonely, but at least there was something to keep It occupied. It came across one pleasing pattern of eight stars around a small black hole. Idly It rearranged them a bit, shuffling the order. This universe had a tendency to put gas in one particular orbit. Ridiculous. It smoothened out the orbits, making them nearly circular, and paused, pleased by the effect. There. At least one thing to remind it of the world before. A little bit further afield there was the planet, orbiting a pulsar and another star. At first It was interested, but the more It watched this triple system the more disappointed it became. The pulsar spun and screamed and kept both the star and the planet it had captured in a kind of chaotic discord that was distasteful to look at. This universe made no sense. It contemplated breaking the aberration apart, but instead went looking for other planets. There were very few. It would take billions more years.

There were so many once. In a past life.

Slowly, very slowly, It nudged galaxies into the shapes it once remembered. Here a great wall, a million galaxies long. Here a cell woven out of walls. It ran along the lines written for it by the dark matter. No life would ever truly appreciate what it did: it was too large and too grand a design, save perhaps for those who would shrink it down to the tiniest dots and sacrifice beauty for insight. This took another couple of billion years.

A little bored, It fell asleep again.

UNIVERSE**

Meanwhile, the universe did what universes generally do - it expanded. That is to say, it expanded faster, causing headaches for future cosmologists.

There were monsters in the void now, and as they spun their temples and gathered more followers they turned into the heart of every-larger galaxies. The great quasar, the one with the greatest black hole ever seen: so great was its influence that under the laws of physics it carved out bumps in the universe itself, distorting it, skewing the beautiful fractals under their own law, like an errant child in a mother’s belly.

The universe fought this state of affairs for a while, but there was little it could do on these scales. Eventually physics gave up and turned back to the rest of the bucket list. Galaxies. More galaxies. Quasars, cooling, gave birth to smaller whorls of star clusters. Early spiral things set around the monsters of the void spun merrily away, forming more stars, merry blue objects in space But some refused; gravitational interactions and dark matter halos turned these into red beasts that refused to make new stars and sputtered through in a kind of grim, ungrowing existence.

Some wheeled into each other and ripped each other apart and settled down as elliptical clouds that spun no more. The universe did its best, setting up a nebula here and there out of the death of greater things, like an undertaker who knew that corpses were good for the soil.

Planets, yes, more planets, more suns too. The dark matter, which had patiently been hanging around since the very beginning doing the spadework, petitioned for more expansion. Granted. From some second layer of algorithmic design came the orders for smaller, newer suns, born out of the corpses of their fathers, with more planets orbiting them. Yes, more of that. It took another billion years, but soon there were planets everywhere.

Millions of galaxies of all shapes hurtled through the cosmic void, laid out like the grandest fishing net ever made, and within them burned thousands of millions of stars, and around these stars spun bits of rock and ice and gas, telling their own merry tale, orbiting each other, getting into fights, catching stray chunks of rock for each other, like a family. Every so often some errant member was ejected or adopted. Chemistry flared on their surfaces: violent skies roiled over cold expanses and rioting continents and gas wrapped themselves in layers so thick some planets turned into impossibly hard diamond. And they spun through the the darkness, burning, freezing, frothing, exploding.

GOD**

When It came to next, the universe had sprouted Life.

Life! It marveled at the prospect, hurrying from one planet to another. Life! Of all the possible permutations and constants in the math - this universe supported life! Molecules met each other, began to replicate, met with more molecules - and soon there were entire galaxies full of the teeming, senselessly reproducing broth. All it took was for one atom with four valency electrons to bond with another - one horribly common element - and here it was! Predictable, of course, but a marvel nonetheless!

Intrigued, It tried to experiment. Where there was Life, there was hope. It found atoms with more valencies, brought together, hoping that they, too, would bond as readily as carbon did. Perhaps one day it would have company, just like in the days of old.

The bond It hoped for didn’t work. They either clung together too tightly or fell apart. The universe would just not support it.

Hope turned to disappointment. It shrieked in senseless rage, extinguishing entire galaxies in its fury. It went back to watching the carbon.

It was boring, and stupefyingly idiotic. The carbon-things threshed in seas of molecular soup for an agonizingly long time, blindly failing, often dying long before they figured out how to move. It was nothing like the Life it knew, the chaotic, rapidly mutating growth that had sprouted inside it a universe ago. This was slow, and stupid, and often died at the slightest change in their host environments. Pretty soon it was down to staring at just a few hundred planets where minuscule things wriggled in the dimmest possible awareness of other things.

At first it seemed promising. The things, over time, figured out how to record instructions - growth, maintenance, self-replication. There were no species, and they met and merged with an abandon that left everything different from everything else, but there was something there. But then things slowed as they got bogged down in ways of storing information.

And even these did not survive. Some bred, and grew more and more complicated; they chased each other in weary circles for aeons, splitting into predator and prey, barely molecules, life only in the sense that they could reproduce. On some planets the circle was so stupefyingly well balanced that neither predator nor prey needed to evolve any further. Some just became bigger and bigger versions of themselves until they could do nothing but sink down and die. Cursed fractals, so ordered. These planets it bombarded with comets, anything that was around, really; once it hit a planet with another planet, and their atmospheres broke and seas drained, and all that was left were a mess of shards with some proto-bacteria clinging feebly to dying microcosms.

When Its rage cooled, it tried to give the stupid things a hand. The seas, on every planet, seemed more promising than the land. Here, molecule, thermal vents undersea: energy. That was one planet. Here, a careful selection of comets into this particular ocean, seeding the surroundings with metals and other things. That was another planet. Here, in the clouds, the gases needed for things to happen. Here, silicate clays replicated structures, held on to them like die casts, until something new came along and fitted into that die in some way and extraordinary reactions began to happen.

Like a gardener It bent over this task. Sometimes It pruned. Sometimes It threw in violent, cataclysmic explosions that, like a spark in a forest, gave birth to blazing chain reactions that burned on for aeons. Eventually there were things that stayed still and things that could move under their own, primitive impulses. On some planets they set off across seas; on others they clung to undersea thermals; on others they orbited metal spikes that were hit by lightning and relied on acid rain to keep them fed. On many they simply died out. Silicon-based life, in particular, was harder to keep alive, except in the most acidic of atmospheres. And everywhere, everything defaulted to mats; things that floated or sank listlessly, a churning ecosystem unto itself, but doing absolutely nothing other than living and dying.

It cried out in anguish again, remembering a time when its race strode the galaxies and mingled, their stars touching each other, entire worlds subservient to their ecstasy. When galaxies, rearranged themselves in seconds into elaborate forms bound only by the most esoteric rules of thought and gravity, simultaneously communication, argument and mating display. And here it was, alone and helpless in this toy universe, with only plants for company.

Brooding, It stretched out among the stars, reaching for the furthest edge, where space was being born, where time was yet unsure of itself. Perhaps this thing would grow into its old dominion: perhaps it might run into another of its kind, another universe, and thus it would be rescued from this dim and weary Life. But the edge fled from it along its pre-ordained path, and gave no answers.

When It returned, It was prepared to be bored again, perhaps to spend the next billion years shifting planets into random orbits and watching them snap back over aeons. But this was a surprise: the Life had advanced! Here, on another, a single mat budded across an entire continent, the heart of an intricate ecosystem that breathed and reacted as a whole to the dust storms and tsunamis that pounded at it every so often. And on yet another fungi spread, melting down all things dead, recasting them into things that floated and crawled and coalesced into the makings of a slow, stupid hive mind. And even where these complex things had failed, the mats remained, resilient, except they were moving about much more now. Some of them had even left their mat-like lifestyle and become multicellular things in their own right.

It watched, interested now. Many things happened the same way, of course, but at these levels of complexity there was always a difference, no matter how slight. It was astonished at how fast the process went with the right nudges. On one world It helped a creeping thing that grew mindlessly, putting out one silicate tendril after another: with a little coaxing it climbed out of the lake of superheated soup it evolved it and crept warily up the nearby volcano, soaking up the heat, until its own mindless greed was defeated by melting and boiling points. On another It stacked mats until they broke down under their own weight and merged a few layers in the most interesting ways. Something vaguely plant-like crawled out of the seas and coalesced from the clouds and onto land.

Faster, now. It nudged multicellular organisms towards sex: all the better to preserve against corruption of their primitive genomes. Things evolved that - after some thought - It thought had heads and tails, and thus a sense of direction.

Not everything went well. Life wiped itself out in alarming ways. Often the environment: one volcano eruption, one tsunami, a little bit too much oxygen, and things died left, right and center: one one planet the mat, having grown on land, crept back into the sea and exploded in a frenzy of feeding and sucked up all the nutrient and turned the seas into a soup in which nothing bigger than itself could live. But a nudge here, a nudge there, and suddenly there were things that burrowed slowly but relentlessly through the mats, turning them into a soup which nourished larger things.

Faster. Faster. It nudged more violently, more eager. Tree-things turned sunwards for energy. Silicate creepers roosted near volcano vents. Proto-fish attacked proto-jellyfish with ferocious abandon and grew armor and scales. A few went back to mud, evolving eyes and preying on the rich ecosystem that existed there. Screeching things descended from branches and trembled before lizards that grew to ferocious sizes, almost too large for their own good. Tentapods fled across savannahs, luring the nimble, leaping insect predators into pits and gorges and primitive traps. It saw one of the planets - the one whose systems’ orbits it had turned into neat circles - doing almost the same thing as another, going with the cold-blooded reptiles. It flicked a carefully calculated comet, figuring that either the screeching things would survive, or the insects would trump them all.

And they grew.

And grew. Against entropy, against all odds - many planets died, many species wiped out, but those that survived, grew.

For the first time in a long time it felt the glimmer of hope. Could these things ever reach the kind of complexity it cherished? It reached within itself, ran the math, millions of times over just to be sure. Yes, possibly; they eventually might. Multicellular organisms became species. Species became races; could grow cities, given time, codifying protocols of behaviour, hive minds of a sort, spreading out, becoming more and more complicated, evolving, ascending, bit by primitive bit, to higher orders . . . given enough time, they could be like it. Not fully like it, but enough like it to reach out to, and pet.

With enough time …

They could even be intelligent enough to have a conversation with, some day.

Anything to take away the loneliness.

It settled down and began to watch. Here, there, the cycles: predator and prey, with both becoming increasingly more adapted to their environments, until catastrophic change wiped them out. As of yet, nothing that looked like it could have a conversation in a million years. Enormous sizes, yes, sophisticated bodies, and yet . . .

The process of adaptation was too good. The organisms too specialized. Intelligence, even general intelligence, was useless. This universe rewarded faster, hungrier, more lethal. It lived for food and sex. It did not care about something that could sit down and think.

Perhaps a few comets were in order. Perhaps a lull, enough of a break in the predator-prey race . . .

It tried a few tricks. The oxygen thing worked on one world. The acid worked on another. A few judicious cross-introductions of species, ferried from one world to the next, provided the atmospheres matched . . . There. A lull.

It was tired. The quasar at Its heart pulsed. Too much energy drained. The system could not hold. Pushing it beyond limits would cause it to collapse. It spun off slow-response thoughts, sent them out as observers to the planets. The universe could spare It energy only for the most mundane of such agents, but it was enough to watch and understand. But there was some success. Here and there, creatures were starting to look around themselves, pick up things, and bash them into other things to see what would happen.

It was a start. By the time the predators had returned, some prey had developed interesting ways of fighting backs. Sticks and stones and rocks, yes, but also language. From sound to complex color-patterns to drawing shapes out of the inky air. Life, it soon came to realize, behaved in odd, unpredictable ways past a certain base level. It was common, for example, for clumps of creatures to band together and fight off the outside world, and start making tools. They would eventually make better tools, started employing various species to either grow their food, or be their food, and hunt less, and start doing all sorts of different things together once the immediate threat was taken care of.

Except some started to fight amongst themselves the moment they had tools, even while all sorts of predators lurked outside their feeble fires. They killed, they maimed, they broke each other, with a curiously extreme empathy, delighting in slaying while they protected their own. And yet these species, which it expected to die out from sheer war-hunger, kept themselves doggedly alive.

It examined Its memories. Was this how Life advanced? Through conflict? It could not remember. Suns flaring in alarm, it called on its nodes again for energy. No - there was some memory, but only the shape of a memory, lost now in the stardust. Perhaps a little more guidance, with a little more energy . . .

Again It spun off thought-strands. This time they were agents, subtle envoys of Its own will. Repetitive, dull, but - it felt its mind falter and flicker briefly as energy debt and the loss of thought strands hit it - maybe they might curb the situation. Agents of peace, resolve, togetherness, invention, chaos.

In the darkness, a star suddenly went supernova, disturbing its thoughts for a while. A noisome haze descended. By the time it recovered, its agents were fleeing across the interstellar distances, and not all to the right targets. It recalled what It could, but some agents had already seeded and were at work.

The effect was immediate. Some - It called them The Hungry Ones - took the agents and espoused them as gods, and went to war with each other over minute variations of the same thought. They bred fast to avoid death. Conflict drove them to greater heights and greater lows; debauchery intermingled with invention in equal measure. The quest to kill faster led them to metal, to alloys; the quest for larger armies led them to primitive structures of order and regime, and soon there were entire colonies of them at war with each other, while their nearest peace-loving neighbors from other suns were sharing the fruits of the most primitive agriculture with each other.

Resigned, It watched the madness unfold. The Hungry Ones built microcosmic nests that bore the strange icons; ideas, some right, some wrong; curious clumps of rock put together to celebrate these ideas; and every so often they would fight, for grander ideas each time, and some would die and others would live, and the only metric for its thought-agents to succeed seemed to be how many they had left alive at the end of it.

Others took the agents and listened to them, and also thought of them as gods, or god-ideas spoken through their equivalent of madmen and prophets. But these became the Peaceful Ones: they traded food and planned ever-more elaborate settlements. Some tried blending in with the world that they lived on, and advanced no more. After a while the mathematics of this nature took its course, and started turning them into more nimble, but stupider versions of their ancestors. These It mourned. Those who had received enough agents of chaos, resolved what they could, but warred over resources and fled from each other, re-learning the art of being apex predators on their primitive food chains.

Was this Life? It wondered, watching the teeming, primitive things kill, and breed, and die, and do the same thing all over again.

Was this how everything started?

It watched and waited, struggling to remember how things had happened.

UNIVERSE**

While its Creator was being forgetful, the Universe got on with it.

By now it had sorted out two basic axioms with regard to this messy business of Life:

1. There were many patterns that were possible, but few that were useful.

Anything that didn’t work was brutally winnowed out, until a few highly resilient patterns remained. The four-and-six-limbed vertebrates, for instance, worked well on land, weather reptile, insect or mammalian, or even other analogues too strange to have nouns for. Things with brains and tentacles worked well in the oceans, as well as the streamlined things with teeth at the front and a decent turn of speed. A certain structure of wingspans worked for avians. Silicate required some interesting twists and turns, and the trees and fungi took their own routes, but carbon-based life generally worked well with skeletons, at least one centralized brain node, and a certain amount of water, methane or ammonia sloshing around their system. Compound organisms were difficult to scale, but enough singular organisms organized in social structures worked very much like compound creatures.

1. Life could be common, but intelligence was rare.

A species that could generally get its food and energy and go about the business of reproducing without getting gobbled up, chewed down or trod underfoot could look forward to a reasonable career with perks stretching into a few million years. A species that hung around thinking and got depressed and began to question the meaning of it all generally had a poor, nasty, brutish and short lifespan. Shifting rocks around into artistic patterns was nice, but tended to be slightly on the redundant side when you were being chased by something with several hundred teeth and a lot of pent-up hunger.

It all went against entropy, but seemed to be a fairly natural part of the whole design document; anyway, the processes for the stars and the black holes and quasars had more or less stabilized by now, and would only become interesting against when gravity ran into its limits and began to recall the edges. The Universe kept the dark matter around for just such an eventuality. It might go, but not without a fight.

In the meantime, Life was interesting enough. One of the earliest races, which had evolved in symbiosis with a kind of tree, looked about the darkness of the night sky with unfiltered light-sending skin arrays and wondered how it might all work. They had few natural predators, except for the great tentacled creatures that rose from the deeps every cycle to devour all that lay in their path, but over time they erected walls, killed a few of the great beasts, and fortified their forests.

They made a few false starts, confused by the agents sent to them, and burned vast swathes of life-trees against each other, until those who remained were those aberrations who had been able to stray the furthest from their life-tree. They rebuilt their societies, weaving the trees into vast structures of polymer and stone, and had just got around to exploring the oceans when a stray comet landed on them and wiped their entire population off the surface of the planet. The last great beasts died of hunger in the great deeps: they had adapted over millions of years to rely on the land for nutrition, and could not go back. Their corpses added enough nutrition to small lakes and seas to keep a race of smaller octopus-like things alive for several thousand years.

Elsewhere, silicon organisms migrated from hot zones to cold; their brains were more efficient in colder climes. A mountaintop civilization, living off veins of rock and previous metals, began the belief that their mountain was the center of the universe, and that beyond the next mountain range lay the very edge; they were proved wrong after a few intrepid explorers, studying the birds, managed to crash outside the mountain range and report their findings by changing patterns in their equivalent of the aurora borealis. These first scientists were promptly recycled upon death and their intellects preserved in the next generation of progeny. There was no point wasting good silicon.

GOD**

It watched over billion of years as the cycles of birth and extinction repeated themselves, fascinated by the drama. Not since the earliest days of this universe had It been this interested. It could forgive this toy universe for its feeble fractals: after all, those were its own faults. A nudge here broke patterns in astonishing ways.

It was vaguely aware that It had not found an answer to whether this was how things were supposed to go. Several thousand black holes had been extinguished in thought. But surely, it reasoned, this was the most interesting way of doing it.

The Peaceful Ones, surprisingly, were the first to leave their little host rocks. It had assumed scarcity of resources would be needed to get things off their planets, and had had little hope for the Peaceful Ones; their resource distribution was far too uniform. But they left - perhaps curiosity? Ambition untrained by war? Either way, they started first reaching out to their moons. And then the planets nearby, building first one, then two, then thousands of communication lines between those who boldly struck out and those who stayed behind.

It watched the slow trails of light pulsing between them, question and answers taking years in the void between the stars.

Quickly the trails became lanes, and the lanes became networks, not unlike living networks, and the networks grew slowly together. The Peaceful Ones spread from one planet to the other, braving harsh conditions to pursue some strange drive locked away within them. Periodically they paused to call out to the stars, flooding their system with radio waves. Once they thought they had found an alien race: but that was the Creator trying to speak to them through the quasar, and they studied the patterns only long enough to filter them out of their system.

Until one day two flying metal tubes from different races met together in the darkness and became friends. There was a growing belief among them that there was a sort of godhood coming, a singularity, and that they could reach it as one.

Omega Point was coming, they whispered to themselves. Omega Point was close.

Happiness. It urged the planets together, excited. Removed small obstacles. Shifted a planet here, a star there, made the orbits easier to compute, removed comets that streaked towards exposed trading stations. And when the Hungry Ones started scanning the cosmos, it dropped subtle hints - here a pulsar beaming out regular signals, giving them hope, there a odd comet sent to pique their interest.

The Hungry Ones were an odd lot. Those that remained, anyway: often there were two or more Hungry races on a planet, and those inevitably ended in genocide. Unlike the Peaceful Ones, they had very little patience harnessing their planets’ energy. They struck out for their host star straight away. At first there were solar power stations; later they became megastructures that bore more than a passing resemblance to Dyson Swarms. Huge webs of panels orbited their sun, giving them the energy equivalent of several hundred races before they had barely left their planet. They pushed things around - first asteroids, then moons, then entire planets. Gas giants they exploited for nuclear fusion. Soon they were venturing out from their systems, and the older races extended their light in benevolence.

The Hungry Ones attacked.

Dismayed, it watched the network recoil and falter. The Hungry Ones fought, and bred, and fought, and bred. They were repulsed, time and time again, but each time they came back better and more ferocious. Anything that was not theirs they took. Entire worlds fell beneath their onslaught. One by one the pool diminished. From time to time they ever purged themselves, wiping out whatever they deemed inferior. Flesh melded with machines; the old skin was dubbed weak, and removed. Melded flesh were made pure machine; the stink of biology eradicated altogether.

Enraged, it flung rock and dust and star-stuff at the Hungry Ones. They fought back against this new threat, unaware of what they were fighting, but even a race that can fight moon-sized asteroids cannot evade the greater things of the universe. Black holes devoured their fleets. Their home planet, the blue on in the nice circle, died a fiery death, and the survivors were left estranged, at the prey of whoever could kill them. They floated apart.

And It looked at the universe with dismay, for now almost everything was undone; the Peaceful Ones retreating, or turning vicious just to stay alive, the Hungry Ones drifting in space, building their ever-repeated microcosms of empires in the void.

Disconsolate, it went to sleep.

It was many millions of years before it woke up again, and It spent those gray ages in a kind of fugue, stars slowly burning out under the computational load of its dreams. In flashes it saw its kind, striding in the spaces between the Void, and all living things in those years were born with a terrible, crushing loneliness.

It woke to something bumping against it.

A child.

A star-child. Empires of space made up its arms, and entire civilizations traded in its mind. It was growing, but blind. The child blundered helplessly into the dark, grabbing the space around it with tiny trails. Curious, it reached out and enveloped the little star-child, watching the trillions of teeming organisms and components that made it up scurry back and forth in furious activity. It could vaguely make out the Hungry Ones, and some Peaceful Ones there, but they had changed somehow, and melded, and worked together in some sort of discordant harmony. Enough harmony to make this work.

Hello, it said.

The star-child did not hear, but bumped into it again. Somehow its presence was reassuring.

Hello, it said softly to the child. Hello, I have so much to teach you. It played with the stars, rearranging them, shifting new wonders into being. Look, look at what you can do.

The star-child reached out and touched it.

And something happened.

Something terrible, something painful. It felt like its insides had been ripped apart, turned inside-out, and it screamed in pain, a cosmic cry that echoed in the background radiation of the universe. When It stopped screaming, and looked at Itself, there were two gaping holes in its body. One where the child had touched it. The other elsewhere, towards one of its computational centers - the black hole at the heart of this particular galaxy.

The child reached into the hole, and its arm, full of starships and space stations, appeared through the other hole. The child started pouring itself into the hole; and soon there were two star-children, diminished, but distinct, and growing.

They had discovered wormhole travel.

For the next millennia It endured uncountable agony as the two star-children punched holes through it, ripped out paths through its insides, and multiplied, and multiplied. Soon there were not two, not four, but twelve children, each childishly shadowing over its own galaxy, playing with suns, and yet bumping clumsily into its body. It reached out to them, pleading for the pain to end; they did not stop. The infant Life reached in, ripping, gnawing, cloning themselves onto new galaxies to conquer. The oldest children fed on the energy of new stars, growing by leaps and bounds.

It blacked out from time to time under the pain, stars going supernova at its edges, and one millenia It woke up from the torture and the children were huge, giants stretching and merging almost the entire length of the universe, their thoughts spanning entire spiral arms. To its surprise they looked very much like the family It had once lost.

And it suddenly understood.

This was how Life was born. In Death.

It screamed. The oldest children heard the scream, played out over aeons, and lifted their heads, puzzled. Thoughts sparking among the hive links of empires, so small compared to It, and yet so powerful already.

Is someone there?

By now it was leaking, star-thoughts diffusing slowly into incoherence. ME, It screamed at them. ME, ME, ME. I am the beginning and the end, I am, I am.

The oldest children held up their hands, and the pain stopped for a while.

Who? they asked curiously.

Me, came the answer, echoing faintly across the stars, but it was too weak to be heard. The children heard no answer. They waited, and eventually lost patience; some intergalactic policy was pushed within the teeming fibres of empires that made them, positing a trade network harvesting energy from around major black holes. It was an ambitious plan, and brought with it the implications of enough energy to grow to a different level altogether.

The children nodded in slow agreement, and reached out, punching the most complicated network of wormholes the Intergalactic Alliance had ever conceived of.

And God died.

CURTAIN FALL**

There is the old adage that a joke is like a blowjob: if you have to explain what you’re doing, it’s a bad one. Let us hope that science fiction is neither, because I need to do some explaining.

[1] The shape of the universe is closely tied to its origin (and vice versa). The closest we seem to come to about thinking about the universe seems to be about one picosecond in, where a number of things happened - the Planck epoch, fundamental forces emerging, space expanding. The laws of physics as we know them today may or may not have existed.

Things [probably] happened like this: there was the Planck Epoch, which is as close as we can approach the universe with sense of time. The universe would have been an unimaginably hot, dense point on a scale that would have made an proton look like the Andromeda galaxy. There may have been dark matter at this stage, pushing the universe to expand, and it would have been an almost completely smooth, homogenous thing.

Of course, theories exist as to what happened before. The Hartle-Hawking state, proposed by James Hartle and Stephen Hawking, postulates that the universe was a singularity in time as well as in space, and that we would have had space without time: a thing of volume, but with no beginning, since the very concept of a beginning demands time. Then there is the string theory landscape, which I don’t understand: if I read it correctly, it suggests that there were initially some 10^500 vacua, or potential states, and some of these manifested, and eventually would cause much headache to people like me who like to read research papers and see if we can understand things. There is talk of multiverses and strings, the latter of which sounds like something a Cosmic Cat would run off with.

Then there is the ekpyrotic model by Justin Khoury, Burt Ovrut, Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok , which is more straightforward: instead of a big bang, the whole thing is actually a big bounce - an oscillating universe that collapses, crunches and is reborn again. The original model seems to have been quite complicated, but current models seem be built with the same ingredients and inflationary models, with no mention of extra branes anywhere. It also neatly ties in to what the Stoics and the Buddhists believed.

Notice that we haven’t even touched the topic of multiple dimensions, or even extra dimensions of time.

The eras afterward much better understood. There was the Photon Epoch, during which particles and antiparticles annihilated each other and electrons and protons hindered photons from getting through, turning the Universe into a dense, insanely hot fog - the cosmic equivalent of instant soup. If there was dark matter here (and I do have it in there) it stuck around. Not too long after, most of the conventional matter in the universe was hydrogen, and nuclear fusion was shutting down. It took over 300,000 years for this universe to become transparent.

My fundamental conceit is that the Universe was created with certain fractal distributions of matter.

(This latter bit was proposed by Luciano Pietronero in the late 1980s: they reasoned that over immense distances, the universe shows aspects of a fractal. Since then these theories have fallen out of favor quite often and keep getting resurrected with every more complicated mathematics (look up multifractal systems). I did this because I happen to like fractals and tend to run Mandelbulbs when bored for the sheer fun of looking at them. They’re pretty.)

At any rate, my story allows me to steal some parts of the ekpyrotic thought, couple that with a Creator and a Cosmic Egg, and begin the whole process somewhere just after the Planck Epoch. You can do Cosmic Eggs if you give your universe an omega-value of slightly greater than 1, at which point it becomes curved and closed in on itself - a sphere. Which is where Euclid’s geometry comes in handy. A cosmic triangle of sufficient size, sketched on the surface of this universe, should have a sum of interior angles that add up to greater than 180 degrees. This is an idea I stole from the comic books “Les Aventures d’Anselme Lanturlu”, created by astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Petit in the 80’s to explain advanced scientific concepts like relativity and the curvature of space and time.

And thus the ball began rolling.

There is an oddity here, though, where the truth is stranger than fiction: about 10 million years into this process, the universe had not evolved stars yet, but could have had water. The background temperature was between 373 K and 273 K, allowing for 7 million years of water.

The universe was literally soup.

Abraham Loeb calls this the ‘habitable Epoch of the early universe’. It’s fascinating: we could have had life in this universe that had water but no stars. Loeb’s paper points out that the background radiation could have kept water and the chemistry required for life running on rocky planets, possibly aided by early clumps that were proto-stars, radiating heat but not yet light. I took the planets out of the equation and postulated little molecules.

[2] Quasars are weird and immensely fascinating things. They’re supermassive black holes surrounded by accretion disks of gas; the disk releases immense amounts on energy on practically every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. They’re understood to be early galaxies that never got around to that business of forming individual stars and decided to just sit there and outperform everything else - the most powerful quasars are thousands of times brighter than our own Milky way. The oldest known quasar (AFAIK, and at the time of writing) is ULAS J1342+0928. It owns the largest supermassive black hole - a void monster that has a mass 800 million times that of our Sun. In my opinion, they should name it something immensely terrifying and badass. Odin, Kali and Apep (the Egyptian god who found Ra to a standstill and eventually wrecked the whole universe) are good places to start. Until we find something even scarier. This is the kind of thing Cthulhu runs away from in gibbering terror.

The really surprising thing, however, was a discovery from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, where an international team of researchers led by Roger Clowes discovered the largest known structure in our universe. It’s a cluster of 73 quasars four billion light-years across. Our galaxy clocks in at a hundred thousand light years across, and the cluster of galaxies that we live in is only a hundred million light-years across. This is a problem, because apparently current astrophysical models set the upper limit for cosmic structures at around 1.2 billion years.

It appears that quasars have not heard of these models.

[3] The early planet the Creator toys around with here is an analogue of Methuselah, aka PSR B1620-26 b. It’s one of the oldest known planets, about 2.5 times the size of Jupiter and around 12.6 billion years old. It orbits a white dwarf (which would have been a healthy star back then) and a pulsar that pulses every few milliseconds. Methuselah might end up wandering the universe as an interstellar planet.

[4] The evolutionary history of life is right up there with the history of the universe for fascinating rabbit holes to delve into. The earliest evidence for life dates to around 4.2 billion years ago, to hydrothermal vents in Canada. Given that the oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago, and the Earth formed 4.54 billion years ago, this is decent ground for thinking that life is not just mathematically possible, but common.

But this life would not have been recognizable to us. Even as far back as 3 billion years ago, we basically had microbial mats figuring out photosynthesis; multicellular organisms came by around 1.7 billion years ago; and organisms with a clear front and back - things that might actually understand the concept of an asshole - appeared 555 million years ago. Land plants came by a little later. Much of the action happened on the sea. It is commonly accepted that all of this descended from an RNA world - a hypothetical state in which self-replicating RNA molecules figured out the business of replication and complex interactions before the more stable DNA appeared. Alternate paths to biochemistry have been proposed, but the RNA world remains our most likely bet.

Because of limits of imagination, I’ve stuck to what I know of terrestrial organisms. We cannot, however, discount alternate types of biochemistry. Life as we know it is carbon-based, with reason: carbon is immensely flexible, with four valency electrons, able to form incredibly complicated chains with both itself and other molecules - that’s how you get proteins. Silicon, the next best contender, is an introvert in comparison. Nevertheless, silicon is extremely common - the abundance of silicon to carbon on the earth is roughly 900:1 - and while silicon analogs of organic carbon compounds are less stable, they can exist. A. G. Cairns-Smith postulates that silicate materials in water may even have been the precursors of carbon-based life, replicating skeletal structures. I’ve used a bit of that here.

I’ve also used the Ediacaran period as leeway for a lot of creative license. The Ediacara are weird things - if the fossil records are right, they look like tubes, bags and mattresses and are completely different from anything that came after. It’s been suggested that they be lumped into an entirely different tree of life, because they don’t fit in any of the three main trees we have. Mark McMenamin said that Ediacarans certain attributes of animal life, but had independently evolved nervous systems and brains, meaning that “the path toward intelligent life was embarked upon more than once on this planet”.

While this is rather sad for the Ediacarans, this holds great promise for alien life, and suggests that we could have gotten smart things earlier if the Earth hadn’t been so hell-bent on making Jurassic Park happen.

[5] The Kardashev scale is in here - just a little bit. Russian physicist Nikolai Kardashev described a scale with 3 base classes, each with a level of energy at their command. Type I (10¹⁶W), Type II (10²⁶W), and Type III (10³⁶W). A species is Type 1 when it can harness all the energy given to its planet by its host star. Some say that this scales with knowledge, and that a Type I civilization would be able to control natural forces, including earthquakes.

A Type II species is one that can harness all the energy of its host star - not just what’s sent its way. The most popular way of doing this seems to be the Dyson Sphere - a megastructure that would wrap around our Sun and absorb all its energy. At this point we’d have mastered fusion.

But Dyson Spheres are difficult to think of, and the gravitational stresses unimaginable. I’ve made use of another idea for the Hungry Ones: the Dyson Swarm, which uses arrays of energy receptors instead of one single megastructure. I’ve also blurred the boundaries a bit here, because I don’t see us plodding all the way through Type I to get to Type II: it’s more likely that most races will aim for the big one - their host star - while working on their local capacity.

A Type III civilization is one that has ascended the limits of the mortal and become a master race able to harness the energy from an entire galaxy. Type III civilizations I’ve presented here as composite entities made of multiple civilizations - the star-children.

[6] And lastly, this whole business of God, the Omega Point and the starchildren themselves. The idea comes from Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and Roman Catholic Priest whose ideas I first came across in Dan Simmon’s Hyperion. Tielhard began to merge evolution and Catholism, and described the evolutionary process - which does not start or stop with humanity - as a road leading to Omega Point: Godhood. God, in his view, lay not in the past, but in the future.

Earth’s biosphere, he explains, evolved before humans existed. One-celled organisms develop, and evolution eventually brings about creatures with complex nervous systems and the capacity for intelligence. Humanity, on their rung of the ladder, creates what he terms a noosphere, a sort of information web (which can be viewed as extelligence); as evolution continues, this noosphere becomes gradually more complex, until it dominates and becomes independent of biological matter, forming a purely metaphysical creature.

It’s a fascinating theory, and it came from a society where such thoughts were heresy. Tielhard was exiled to China by the Church. It was only after he died in 1955 that his writings became available. He postulates that this will let humans escape the heat death of the universe, something my main character - God - does right at the start. While the theory cannot be scientifically proven, it is beautiful, and is the centerpiece of my story.

I hope you enjoyed it.
