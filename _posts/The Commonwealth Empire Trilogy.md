## Synopsis

*The year is 2033. The British Empire never fell. Communism never happened. The Commonwealth flies the flag of the Empire. Many of the Empire’s colonies are stripped bare in the name of British interests, powerless to resist. Upon this stage is Ceylon – a once-proud civilization tracing itself back to the time of the Pharaohs, reduced but not dead. The Great Houses of Kandy still control the most lucThe Technology of the Commonwealth Empires
rative trade routes, since even dust and ashes can serve a purpose.*

A machine uprising in a biopunk Ceylon, and the consequences of these events.

Look at what arrived a couple of weeks ago: the ARC of the Inhuman Peace, the second book in my Commonwealth Empire trilogy! I’m told by Gautam Shenoy that the books have already started showing up in bookstores, so . . . it’s out?? It’s out!

So I’m actually quite happy that this book is out, because it’s easily been one of the most difficult parts of my career so far as a writer. I’ve technically been writing the Inhuman Peace from somewhere around mid-2019 to late 2020 or thereabouts; it’s hard to keep track of the various permutations and versions, because I’ve rewritten this book at least four times.

It wasn’t all to do with the complexity of the book; there was a lot going on in my personal and professional life that meant I wasn’t always in the best headspace for writing, and as a result I made mistakes, which then required me to go back and correct the manuscript. At times I felt the manuscript was too complex – you know how complexity for the sake of complexity just makes a story unbearable? And at times I felt that it wasn’t quite doing justice to my original intent of filling out the years in between the two halves of the Inhuman Race, which was the first book in the series.
The Technology of the Commonwealth Empires

In fact, in the middle of writing this, I took some time off to go and write The Salvage Crew , which turned out to be surprising success, selling far more than the Inhuman Race has to date. I think that was when I realised that I write better when I’m having fun. You’d think this is a fairly obvious axiom, but it did take me awhile to learn it. Armed with that knowledge, I came back and gave the Inhuman Peace the top to bottom rewrite that put it into the form it is today.

The current version is something that I’m happy with. It sets up not just what happened in the 15 year-void within the Inhuman Race, but it also showcases a lot more of the world that I built in my head – its past, its present, a little bit more of the tensions within both this fictional Ceylon as well as the empire that governs it. It’s a book about slow changes and tipping points – technological, societal, political, and the thousands of little pieces that lead there. It’s got the action where the action should be and the introspection where the introspection should be. I’m relieved that the handful of people that I managed to give advance reading copies to have also come back and said that they enjoyed it:![[commonwealth3.png]]
The overwhelming feeling is relief. I’m never fully satisfied with anything I write, but – it’s done. It’s out. As with all my books, it has a few nods to subjects here and there that the handful of readers are going to get, and I think I’m going to enjoy seeing them figure stuff out and reach out to me.

So, where does the story end? The last book of the Commonwealth Empire trilogy – and this is a book that I am on contract for – is the Inhuman War. This time I’m going toward avoid the pitfalls of the process; I’m going to be taking a step back and outlining The Inhuman War while I work on two other novels. I estimate that writing will begin sometime late next year (2022) and be done sometime in 2023. I’m not going to give away too much of the plot right now, but if I play my cards right, we should be able to see even more of the world that I talked about in a very old blog post of mine about The Technology of the Commonwealth Empires.

Reading the proofing copy of the Inhuman Peace. Not gonna lie, I'm relieved to have this done and in my hand. This is the book I was afraid of - the 400-page followup act to my eccentric postcolonial love note to Bioshock. Fingers crossed.

IT'S DONE! IT'S FINISHED! THE INHUMAN PEACE MANUSCRIPT IS READY! DOBBY IS FREE!

**19/3/2021:**

Checking edits and preparing the final manuscript of the Inhuman Peace. I had meant to hit 70K words edited by now, but it's 4 AM and I'm exhausted. I'm going to grab some dinner/breakfast and get some sleep.

2019 might have had some real low notes in it, but it ended well: I finished the second book in the Commonwealth Empire series, and booped it off to Swati Daftuar at HarperCollins India.

I’ve written about this particular beast before.  I had a great deal of trouble with the thing. I finished the first version quite early – somewhere in March – but it just didn’t feel right: there were several interesting characters I wanted to bring in, among which was a prototype Inquisitor called Eliott Grimme. He, Charlotte Plague, and Gregory Mars were three of the first four Horsemen – the Reaper, Plague and War, respectively. To a large extent the novel was a dialogue between different generations of Inquisitors fighting against, and coming to terms with the fact that the little machines in my fictional Colombo would be their successors.

Unfortunately, the balance was off. Much of what made the novel Sri Lankan simply fell by the wayside: Ceylon through Eliott Grimme’s eyes was yet another backwater colony, yet another hostile topography to walk over. These people are, after all, colonial instruments.

Version two was finished in July. This time the balance was closer, but the background detail of Ceylon was still . . . not up to what it was in my notes, which went something like this:

WHAT IS THE CHINESE PORT CITY’S GAME HERE

HOW DOES CEYLON WORK UNDER THE BRITISH

EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS NO INTERNET IN THIS WORLD

HOW DOES THE INQUISITION FUNCTION

HOW DO THE BOTS ACQUIRE A LANGUAGE COMPLEX ENOUGH TO ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD AROUND THEM

So I sat down in December, after Christmas, and told myself version three would be the final. I’d use the material from version one and two, but fundamentally reconstruct the whole story from scratch – including typing it out line by line, swapping the point of view of Eliot Grimme out for characters that would play a greater role in things to come, and exploring the city of Kandy in more detail. I also wanted the book to fit between the two halves of the story shown in THE INHUMAN RACE – to show how and why Kushlani de Almeida, the protagonist of the second half of the book, goes from being in second-in-charge of what is essentially a battle Royale with humanoid machines – to sacrificing her career and her life to make a legal case for giving those same machines fundamental rights.

The result: THE NATIVES ARE RESTLESS, a little larger than THE INHUMAN RACE. The title is just an internal name - the actual title will be THE INHUMAN PEACE. I had teasers of the Lanka Resistance Front and the political unrest in Kandy while the story happened: those were brought out more, and certain characters took on a life of their own when it came to making hard choices.

And it fits right where I expected it to be.

Saturday. Powercut. I’ve been lying in bed going through the editor’s feedback on the Inhuman Peace (book two of my Commonwealth Empires trilogy).*

The feedback for book one and two has has been largely the same: “show us more of this alternate Ceylon!”

I had intended the first book to be short, sharp, a setting of the gameboard, as it were, and I was wary of over-writing and over-describing. I opened the second book with alt-Britain, and then moved on to alt-India; Goa, to be precise. Then I launched into the Ceylon, which my Sri Lankan readers know and can intimately connect to – but not something that a reader elsewhere would understand with such easy shorthand.

Now I need to a) dial in alt-Britain and b) sketch out the Ceylon scenes with as much detail – really take those notes and maps and describe my Pearl of the Indian ocean more.

This is good, because I can talk about the world more, and in light of the recent April bombings in Sri Lanka I feel I have more things to say about how people recent to shock and loss. This is also going to be tough, because it means I’ll have to take apart large chunks of the story and redraft – I don’t want to do a Robert Jordan and weave in endless descriptions for the sake of detail. Things have to make sense. Different characters notice different things, and all of us privilege some types of information over others; there’s a limit to how much omniscience I can pull off here.

I’ve technically written one novel and five short stories this year (and led another large project I can group under ‘futurism’). It’s been a really good six months of writing. But as I approach the end of my workload, I feel heavier, because some of this stuff won’t be out for years.

Book one seems to have been more read by writers than readers – it’s cited in articles and so on, but Goodreads shows only a handful of reviews (maybe that’s a facet of it only being available on the Indian subcontinent). I hope this situation changes.

Finally began work on The Inhuman Peace, the second book of the Commonwealth Empire for HarperCollins.

Of course, in my alternate reality, Douglas MacArthur attained the highest possible rank in the British Army. The Commonwealth kept his skills in demand, the the Russians once brought him in as the only man they trusted to mediate a peace treaty with Japan. This was just after the second Russia-Japan battle over Manchuria.

And Sir Terry Pratchett probably stuck to his original occupation as a journalist. Once knighted, he pursued his fascination with astronomy and the natural sciences. He never got around to writing the Discworld, but he still made people go "ooh!" and rethink the way they looked at the world.
