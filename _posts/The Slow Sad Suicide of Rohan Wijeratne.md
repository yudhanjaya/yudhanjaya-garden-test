# **1**

The man sat at the bar. Cigarette smoke curled around him, drifting down, as if weighed down by his thoughts. The bartender asked him if he wanted another arrack. Double ekak (make that a double), he said. He'd heard that arrack and sleeping pills could kill you. He already had the sleeping pills. Good. Deftly, before anyone noticed, he swept the pills into his mouth. One swallow. Two. The barman brought the shot. He drank it. Ah. When he woke up it was to the sound of a hospital. A vague ceiling rotated under him. He was pushed. He was floating. Thus began the worst period of the brief and privileged life of Rohan Wijeratne. He spent the next nine days in an overpriced bed tended by overpriced doctors flanked by underpaid nurses. Every so often they would appear and adjust his voltage. The electricity tingled and burned. Nausea swept over him. The nanites in body, repairing the damage. His girlfriend came once, pursed her lips, decided that the house and the three cars weren't worth all this nonsense, and left. By the time he could walk again he had even less than when he started. You can't keep doing this, said the insurance agent, who was a good-looking middle-aged woman in a suit exactly one size too small for her. It made her look like an elaborately squeezed balloon. Mr Wijeratne, when your parents bought you that insurance policy, they meant you to live... It didn't work before, did it? The time he'd thrown himself off the balcony. Or the time he'd opened his veins with a kitchen knife. Or the time he'd tied his neck to the ceiling fan. That had been painful, but here we are, skin knitted with barely a scar. Fucking insurance. Fucking parents. Fucking nanites in his bloodstream. The company never had to pay. As long as the nanites existed they would keep him alive. Rohan brooded. Now if he tried to off himself again they'd say it was because of the breakup. Tehani wasn't the kind of girl you killed yourself over. Sure, her face might launch a thousand ships, or at least a hundred Ubers, but only as long as she kept her mouth shut. The minute she spoke the average IQ of the room plummeted by several thousand points. Even Rohan, never the sharpest knife in the drawer himself, understood there was something slightly off about his bipolar Colombo princess. Not a girl worth dying for, that one.

When he got out of hospital the first thing he did was go see the Monk. Is it cowardice to kill yourself? he asked the Monk. The Monk, who never walked anywhere, rearranged her saffron robes. Could be, she said. Or is it courage? The Church says it's a sin, said Rohan. The Church says many things, said the Monk mildly. In my philosophy un-attachment is the ultimate goal. Very few have the courage to extend to life the same philosophy they apply to their bank account. So why are you still here? The Monk showed him her wrist. There was a single, short, vertical scar, with four stitches across it. Not for lack of trying, said the Monk. What happened? I found the truth. What was the truth? That I don't have the balls for it, she said placidly. Rohan, feeling awkward, offered to have a pack of cigarettes delivered to her, but she waived the offer. Ineffective, she said. Takes too damn long to do the job. Rohan, still feeling awkward, went to check on his friends. Most of them had no idea where he'd gone or why his hands shook so much. Some woman, they assumed. Or maybe he was tripping again, wired up to the eyeballs, tapping the good old 320v mains electricity for the ultimate high. They cheered and ordered many rounds of drinks and conveniently vanished just before the bill came. SMOKING CAUSES HEART DISEASE, said the packets they left behind. Not my heart, Rohan said to the packet. SMOKING HEART DISEASE It hurt. Rohan Wijeratne looked out over the empty lights and glowing faces and wept.

On Monday he went out with a friend who had bought a new car. He listened politely to his friend's explanation of why the BMW, with its bulletproof glass and antigrav engine, was worth being in debt for the next fifteen years. It felt like he was trying to convince himself, really. Going back home, he looked up at the sky, and found himself searching for a face. An eye, perhaps. A great Eye of starfire. Floating in the void. Something. Nothing. Sir, tuk-tuk? said a man helpfully. Rohan agreed and let himself be led home, still thinking of an Eye in the Sky. Eye in the Sky. Eye in the Sky. It stuck in his head. My Invisible Friend is better than yours, infidel, he thought. The tuk guy's chatter cut through the moment. Watching him sweat over the poor electric trishaw, Rohan was struck by a curious question: what if he was poor? Certain it did him no good, being rich. Being rich meant you had to think of all the cars, the servants, the maintenance, the whatnot. Being rich got you augmented. Being rich meant your parents thought of you as a fucking asset and got you injected early on with the nanite equivalent of Wolverine's healing factor. Nobody ever said it would be fun. A tuk-tuk man might conceivably have him mind free to think of the higher things in life, but you really couldn't do that while driving the Merc and wondering if that valet fucker had just scratched your paintjob. On the whole, reasoned Rohan, maybe it might be nice to be poor for a bit. Maybe life was only worth living if you had something to struggle against. The e-cigarette glowed in the night, a seductive danger light. So he did the simplest thing he could think of: he bought the trishaw on the way home. The tuk-tuk driver, who could not believe his luck, wondered briefly whether to worship this stupendously drunk lansi bugger. He decided not to and scuttled off into the dark with his two million rupees, dreaming of a trishaw empire. And thus for a brief while the good people of Colombo had to deal with a disconcertingly well-dressed trishaw driver who the bouncers at Silk knew by name.

It was here, in the shadow of wannabe nightclubs, that he first heard about the Titor Project. Some nerd. Kid, really. Drunk and on his phone. Yo, did you hear about Titor? Pause. No, no, it's crazy, right, they're going to send someone right into the event horizon, right? Fucking meta. Yeah, yeah, whoever - I mean, yeah, it's suicide, but, like, imagine what we could observe ... Pause. If that guy ever came back ... Rohan craned his neck back. What was that? A long pause. Yeah hold on my tuk guy is talking to me. Rohan repeated the question. The Nerd surveyed him through glasses lit by cheap neon light. Suicide, that's what it is, he said. They take a guy and send him right into a black hole. You know what a black hole is? I know what a black hole is. A dead star gone bad, said the Nerd, as if Rohan hadn't spoken. Place in the universe so dense not even light gets out. It drifts through the void eating stars. Lucy in the sky with kotthu. Why are they shooting people into it? Because time stops in a black hole, said the Nerd reflectively. If the ship can survive the tidal gravity and the firewall doesn't incinerate you and the Schwarzchild radius is below the Ouch horizon whoever goes there might be the first human to see a black hole up close and survive to tell about it... Loud, thumping, repetitive beats cut off his words. They arrived. A gaggle of girls in beautifully short dresses swept past. The Nerd's eyes glazed over. He tossed Rohan a five hundred. Keep the change, he muttered, taking off after the girls. Rohan gave the five hundred to the bouncer and went away. That night he dreamed of girls in short dresses orbiting a kotthu.

A few days later. SuicideWatch. He didn't go on the site much, but there was a certain kink to watching people off themselves spectacularly in public. MAKE THEM REMEMBER YOU, said a banner. It unfurled majestically. Since the dawn of the modern scientific era, it said, science has been fascinated by the black hole. Our equations predict it, our science fiction immortalizes it, but in all our years we have never managed to put a human cosmonaut close enough to observe it. Do black holes lead to other universes? Or is it simply the most spectacular death in the universe? The Association for Scientific Progress is looking for volunteers for the journey of a lifetime. Die for a cause. Make history. Let the whole world watch your final moments. Find out more. Rohan clicked, fascinated. Smart of them, advertising in a suicide forum. The Association for Scientific Progress, they said, was an organization searching for humanitarian ways to remove the ethical constraints that inhibit scientific research. Right, got it. An image. A white ring, glowing, staring at him out of a darkness dusted with stars. The Eye of God. Officially Astronomical Index No. S13-23. A black hole that spun so fast it formed a ring. Zero thickness but non-zero radius, a Kerr singularity, said the ad. We believe that it is possible to enter the Ring in such a way that ... avoid the singularity... is possible that this even exists in five dimensions, breaking the laws of physics as we know them...in such a case the Kerr black hole acts as a sort of wormhole, possibly even a traversable wormhole. So that was what the Nerd had been talking about. Rohan scrolled down, down. After half a dozen disclaimers, the meat began. Thirty five years of frozen travel at half-lightspeed. A month of Thaw. You would set up video equipment, begin recording. Heartbeat, mass, the works. The ship, pumping out information, would orbit the black hole, surfing space for hydrogen, picking up fuel to pump the broadcast and power the engines. Anyone watching from the outside - years later, mind you - would see you going slower and slower and slower until you came to a full stop. You would then slip into a path between what the boffins called the event horizons, and after that there would be absolutely no return. Everything you saw would go through a public feed. Eventually. Many years from now. Speculation is rife, said the website. The truth is that nobody knows what lies on the other side of the singularity. The Titor Project seeks to find out what really happens. It will advance our knowledge and our awe of the cosmos like nothing before. And if it turns out to be so much horse crap, said Google, the wise old man of the internet, the gravity would rip you apart. You would die with a front-row seat to the most spectacular spectacle in the universe. And nothing could bring you back from a black hole. Not even the insurance nanites. It would be the ultimate suicide. The black eye glowed on his screen. A ring of zero thickness but non-zero radius. And if it is the Eye of God, thought Rohan, he had a few motes to pluck out of it. He began filling in the application.

One of the perks of being filthy rich is being gene-engineered to the point of absurdity. One of the perks of being gene-engineered is having a body that can heal fast (too fast), survive longer (too long) and generally improve on the human experience. Latticework bones. Better than average strength. Reaction times. Perfect, said the boffin, who seemed to speak without pause. Mr Wijeratne, why are you doing this? It's for the good of science and progress, doctor, Rohan said with a straight face, body held at absolute attention. Humanity can only advance if we put our best foot forward. One of the other boffins looked skeptical, but most of them nodded eagerly. They didn't seem to realize that it was their own PR copy spun at them. You are a brave man, Mr Wijeratne, said the boffin, who was a kindly Uncle Type with a balding head and a permanent look of worry. His self-preservation instinct is almost nonexistent, said the Skeptical Type. Norepinephrine production blocked from birth, according to this. Is it bravery if you're not afraid? Both Rohan and the Uncle glared at him. Well onward, then, onward, said the Uncle. Mr. Gunasakeram. A word with you in private ...

The rest of it was a whirl. They took him past the endless lines of unnems and junkies and whores wanting a good way out. They took him past the lines of the psychologically unstable and the physically disabled. The lines watched him go, green with envy and also with fear. They strapped him to a machine that hummed and whirred and asked him questions and measured his brain waves. They showed him the ship he would go on. It's the latest design, said the Skeptical Type. We call it the Pathfinder 3. Carbon-nanotube frame and shell, with sensors built into the hull itself. A layer of liquid hydrogen around the center of the ship - that's where you'll live - to minimize radiation damage. Rohan thought it looked like a coffin. He wanted to ask what happened to Pathfinders 1 and 2, but decided not to. Bussard ramjet engine based on the CNO cycle, continued the Skeptical Type. It projects an electromagnetic field in front of you to scoop interstellar hydrogen for use as fuel. It won't work very well around these parts - there's not enough material around - so we'll pre-seed your flight path and slingshot you through fuel caches here and here to start the engine. You won't notice, of course- we'll freeze you here, on earth, and you'll be Thawed out by the computer at a safe distance from the Eye. Sounds like fun, said Rohan. Skeptical Type gave him a Look. We're going to freeze you and slingshot your unconscious body into a black hole, he tried. Like I said, said Rohan, I'm up for it. They gave him a very expensive latte and told him he was free to go. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors aren't responding like they should, said the Skeptical Type, watching Rohan go. History of suicide attempts, well hidden. I think there's some damage to the amygdala, some repairs, I don't think his nanites have done it properly. The others are just as damaged, said Uncle Type. And he's one of the few geneborn who signed up. But sir- Uncle Type's phone beeped. His wallpaper was a great and beautiful eye, drawn in white fire across black nothingness. The Ring. Catch-22, Mr Gunasekaram, the Uncle Type said, tapping away. They have to be crazy to want to go. We just have to prove they're not. Or very minimally crazy. Need to make this whole thing legal. They'll die. Uncle-Type rubbed his face. We'll all die, Mr Gunasekaram, he said. They'll just die famous.

They say God made the world in six days. First the heavens, then the earth, and finally the whole human race. On the seventh day He looked around, decided the job was done, and retired to a quiet life of making prawn toast for the rest of eternity. If you hurry across the millennia you might still catch His prawn toast at Mintage. The epiphany that the Heavenly Blessed Prawn Toast gave unto Rohan Wijeratne was this: being poor was not worth it. One, the neighbors were starting to look askance. It is one thing to excuse a man's failings when he drives a Mercedes Benz. It is another thing entirely to do so when his carriage reads Bajaj on the front. Two, while he was certain that the average tuk driver was more intelligent than most of the people he drank with, there was a terrible monotony to that life that made him want to scream. No drugs. No beach parties. Their drama was limited to the price of sugar and the velocities involved in cutting a traffic lane without being run over. On bad days Rohan would park near a paddy field and moo despondently at the cows. They would moo back and go back to chewing their grass. That, he felt, was an accurate portrayal of the company of tuk drivers. Besides, he had to prepare. The instructions were surprisingly simple. Come to Beijing. Bring a passport, bring a change of clothes. Sort out your will. The will. He pondered over this. Or rather, he pondered it through a glass of arrack. Sir, closing, said the waiter at Mintage. He didn't care. He tossed the will aside and stared at a spectacularly beautiful girl at the next table. She had a tattoo of the Deathly Hallows on her white skin. He wanted to go over, to talk about unicorn hair and dragon heartstring, but she looked like she was ten years younger and she looked like she was having fun. He looked down at the document he'd been scribbling on. There, on the legalese, he'd scribbled the Eye. A ring of darkness that beckoned. That waited for him, sixteen light years away, devouring stars. There was a road laid out for him, twisting between those world-eating rings, through them. Time to go, sir, said the waiter gently. He agreed.

Rohan Wijeratne woke up thirty five years later in a box. Vapor curled around him, like cigarette smoke from a lifetime away. He's up, said various devices who knew him as PASSENGER 113. They watched him stumble around in the weightlessness of the pod, and judged it safe to transmit once the human had figured out how to use his magnetic boots. 113 read his messages. There was a female whose clip he dismissed in seconds. There was a female with shaved head who he listened to for much longer. Then a series of others he scrolled through. Ship, he said, where are we? EN ROUTE TO THE SINGULARITY, said the machine. Can I see it? The wallscreen obliging faded to transparency. There was darkness, and a light dusting of star-points. I can't see anything. The image shifted. There. The machines watched as 113's mouth fell open. He put his hands on the wallscreen, as if to reach out and grab the Eye. They had shown him an iris, outlines in fierce white. What he saw now was a great distortion: a hole in the universe that was darker than the rest of space, surrounded by a great, shining haze that seemed to stand out from the rest of it somehow. The Eye of God, he breathed, and every word and action was captured, analyzed, sent back to Earth. It's quite similar to a Reissner-Nordström hole, said a voice. Rohan jumped. On one part of the screen was a helmet and a face. Pale skin that gleamed an unhealthy white under the cold light. Who're you? 116, said the face. I'm your partner. Here, let me wave at you. A dot at the far edge of his space display flared a brilliant green. They sent us out in pairs, remember? How long have you been awake? Just woke. Get some rest, said 116. Takes a while to recover from Thaw. When he woke up, the voice was still talking. ... Conventional wisdom - and I'm mostly using the paper model here - is that we have a singularity surrounded by two event horizons, right? And at the center you have the wormhole or what have you. I think Carter was right. I think we're actually looking at a wormhole that connects to an infinite number of spaces. I think in just one the black hole is repulsive and you get the white fountain effect ... Yeah. Yeah. Look. Four horizons. External horizon coming in from our end, internal horizon coming in from our end, and unless you do find that repulsive spot, internal horizon on the other end, external horizon on the other end. If it does turn out to be a white fountain, we probably won't have horizons. Hello, said Rohan cautiously. You're awake! said 116. Ladies and gentlemen, my companion. Who're you talking to? The future, said 116. They're recording us, remember? All of this is being beamed out. Rohan felt confused. It took a while to understand. There was something, like a cloud, a feeling of walls in his mind. There was a brief moment of panic. I - I don't think - I can't remember, he said. The face on the wallscreen looked concerned. You alright, buddy? Hey. Ship. Hey, ship. Status report on 113? Anomalies? Neural activity below pre-Freeze status, the Ship replied smoothly. How much below? Ship quoted a number. The face went silent. SUBJECT APPEARS TO BE EQUIPPED WITH NANITES IN ORDER TO ATTAIN PREVIOUSLY EXHIBITED LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE, Ship offered. IT APPEARS THE THAW MAY HAVE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED NANITE ACTITIVTY IN HIS BRAIN. HOWEVER, INTELLIGENCE THRESHOLDS ARE NOT BELOW PROJECT MINIMUM. THIS CONVERSATION WILL BE ERASED FROM THE TRANSMISSION LOGS IN TWENTY SECONDS. Jesus Christ. They've given me a trust-fund vegetable. CONVERSATION ERASED IN THREE SECONDS, said Ship. Hello? said Rohan again. 116 sighed. Not to worry, buddy, the voice said. Let's just enjoy the ride.

When he woke again, he tried exploring the place he was in. There was his creche, with the tubes and the wires and the things that Ship insisted he hook himself up to every so often. It was pretty comfortable in there. The creche sat in a small, dark room. Words drifted into his mind. Airlock was one of them. IN THE EVENT OF A HULL BREACH YOU WILL BE EJECTED, Ship said. HOWEVER NOTE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A HULL BREACH AND EJECTION YOU ARE STATISTICALLY UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE THE COLLAPSE OF THE LIQUID HYDROGEN LAYER, OR FOR THAT MATTER, THE VACUUM OF OUTER SPACE, FOR ANY USEFUL LENGTH OF TIME. That's reassuring, said Rohan. THANK YOU, said Ship primly. The next room was what he'd mentally dubbed the living room. There was a table, and a chair, and an exercise machine, all facing the space display. All of it seemed to be built into the walls and the floor itself. There was a pull-out tray thing that dispensed chunks of processed food, vague squares that tasted vaguely of chicken and looked like chocolate pudding. He flailed around briefly and discovered a shower cubicle. Beyond that was a room Ship refused to let him enter. MANUAL OVERRIDE ACCESS ONLY IN EVENT OF MALFUNCTION OR ENTRY INTO THE EVENT HORIZON, it told him. Rohan looked around. He was aware that he was in a very small space, the size of a small apartment. He had a sudden urge to step outside, to tell Ship to blow the creche out of the airlock, to end it all. He sat down and tried to remember. Mintage. He remembered Mintage, The prawn toast, that exquisite creation, going down with the slow tones of a Halmilla bottle. Blood. Lots of it, streaming from his wrists. Blood on the sofa, on the coffee table, on the doorframe. Doctors. Faceless. The insurance man, whispering - Hey, buddy, said the screen. How's it going? It was 116 again. I could do with a cigarette right now, Rohan said. 116 laughed. It was a short bark of a laugh. How's the Eye looking today? Rohan tried. Oh good, good, said 116. There was that happy lilt in his voice when he spoke of the Eye. You know, if you look real close, the Eye has rings? Rings plural? Oh yeah? I think one of them is a galaxy, said 116. Tessier 361 is that way. The damn thing's bending space so much it's distorting the light around it. Look, see for yourself. You see that white ring? And then that reddish ring, sort of shifted to aside, inside the white ring? White's stuff way behind the Eye. The red is, I think, whatever's left of the star that got pulled in, Doppler-shifted to hell ... Rohan squinted at the screen. The Eye did seem larger today, but he couldn't make out any rings. You really like this stuff, don't you? he said. Of course, said 116. He seemed astonished. Don't you? Rohan shrugged. So what were you, before? Astrophysicist, said 116. You? Alcoholic. There was a pause. Right. So how long to the Eye? FORTY-ONE DAYS, THREE HOURS AT PRESENT VELOCITY, said Ship. THOUGH I MUST INFORM YOU THAT THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE SINGULARITY THE LESS - Good. Let's get it over with, said Rohan, and went back to brooding.

Had he finished school? He couldn't remember. There was a jumble of light and song, of grey and white uniforms and a bottle spinning on the table between them. School ended. The uniforms gave way to short skirts, jeans. Scribbling notes for an MBA knowing that he would never use any of what he learned. His notes burning, burning as they smoked weed and danced around the bonfire. Cut. His knife scratching the hard wood of the table at the bar, dancing circles around the bottle of alcohol. The knife flipped, bent, buried itself in his thigh, his face smashed in by a steering wheel. Drunk driving, the officer had said as they wheeled him away, first of a lifetime of visits to the hospital. Crazy. He drove right into the house. The girl's dead. Your parents have licensed a very expensive insurance package, said the lawyer, handing him a pen. Sign here and we'll take care of it. A sudden press of pain. The nanites will keep you alive for a long, long time, said the lawyer. Company policy. They'll pay if you're beyond repair. A brief look flashed over his face, jealousy, contempt. Live long and prosper, he whispered, leaving Rohan to the bed and the cold lights and the ugly smell of the hospital. You see? said the monk. She was seated cross-legged on the edge of his bed, slit wrists pouring red onto his sheets. No; she was floating. You're not here, said Rohan. This is a dream. Everything is a dream, she said sadly. We're just God's nightmare.

There didn't seem to be much to do on the Ship other than wait. There was no day or night out here, but some thoughtful fellow had thought of simulating the sun's lighting in the ship; and so Rohan found something to set a routine by. Mornings were when the light was cold and clear; on mornings he woke, exercised, ate. Evenings were when it dulled a bit and took on a reddish tint. At first he passed the time between the two reading. There was no Internet out here, no Facebook, no Instagram; he felt isolated, his hands falling into old habits, tapping on apps and notifications that were no longer there. Then he discovered the VR instruments, and his evenings took on wilder hues - sex sims, videogames in which he flew, or drove for miles, or cut down dragon after dragon, a lone human dancing to his fantasies in the depths of space. Night was the most interesting. That was when the Ship took on soft blueish hues, the space display open, and 116 woke. The green flash would wink on and off in the distance. I'm a nocturnal creature, he explained cheerfully. Any change in the Eye? Rohan felt grateful to have someone along with him. It was profoundly lonely. No, none at all, he would say. I watched Friends today. Days blurred into weeks. The Eye grew slowly. Soon he could make out the rings that 116 kept talking about, and something else; a faint shimmering, a sort of movement inside the eye itself, a vague haze of light that made ... Ship, he said. Can you magnify the image? Yes, said Ship. And all of sudden it was there, right in front of him. A great eye, wreathed in starlight, a pupil as black as the night. A thousand glowing suns orbited it, their light from millions of years away bent around the singularity and thrown like a spear into Rohan's eyes. It’s supposed to look like a ring, he said. It is a ring, said 116. Mathematically, of course. Call up your ship's overlay. You see those four regions? Lines appeared on Rohan's screen. So that's the ring singularity itself, said 116, his voice tracing the lines across the distance between them. Here's the inner and outer event horizons . . . here's the ergosphere...you see that light circling the eye. You know we can get in there and still get out? Yeah? If these ships were faster, yeah, said 116. But we'd be pulled towards the ring...nah. You and I, my friend, are going straight in. Or at least as straight as we can. Into the middle? Something of the sort, said 116. We won't get ripped apart, or at least that's the idea. Rohan imagined burning towards that pupil, engines screaming, star-stuff whirling around his head. It sounded like the perfect way to go. But it's a bit of work. If it turns out we've taken the wrong route, we might just end up so much spaghetti over the ring. Can't we just point and go straight in? Not that simple, said 116. It's too curved down there. We can't tell from here whether we're on the right path or not. Can't even see the damn curvature, can we. So what if we miss? What if we miss? said 116. That's what the others are for. You think we're the only ones out here? Watch this. Ship, roll-call, silent. In the distance, green lights flashed, like little stars going nova. Rohan craned his head. A constellation of green, a spearhead made of fireflies, riding the darkness towards the Eye. Don't you remember? No I don't, said Rohan. But he felt comforted all the same.

In layman's terms, a black hole is the corpse of a dead star, said the Skeptical Type earnestly. Imagine all of space as a rubber sheet with droplets of water on it. Every object that you put on this sheet bends it slightly, making some of those water droplets run towards it. Objects like you and I are too small to attract too many drops, but the Earth, the Sun, the other stars - they attract plenty. This bending of the rubber sheet is what we humans perceive as gravity. Sometimes a star of sufficient size can collapse under its own gravity and simply be crushed out of existence, leaving behind a region of space where the rubber sheet is so bent that all the water is pulled towards it. In physics, we call this a singularity - a single point where the curvature of space-time is absolutely infinite. Even light, once caught, gets sucked in. To extend the analogy further, imagine lines on this rubber sheet dividing the surface into a perfect grid. Light travels on these straight lines - we call them geodesics. Bend the sheet into a cone and you'll notice that these straight lines warp and curve. Anyone who doesn't know about the rubber sheet and the original lines would assume that the lines curved. In reality, it's the sheet-space-time itself. Rohan yawned. Skeptical Type was terribly earnest. He skipped the video a bit. Imagine that we're approaching a ring singularity. It's rotating, because that's what gives it the disc - our traveler will first need to match the rotation. A traditional blackhole can be thought of as a point surrounded by a circular event horizon. The event horizon marks the point at which one can no longer escape the black hole; after our traveler enters it, in a short while, gravity and tidal forces will rip their atoms apart and the singularity devours them like it does the stars and anything else that wanders across its path. But a ring singularity - our Kerr black hole - is different. The bend in space-time is not towards a point, but around the outer and inner edges of the ring. In theory, this black hole forms a torus in space-time, gluing together two universes with the singularity in the middle and not one, but four event horizons, two in each universe: one of the outer side of the ring, one on the inner. As we pass the inner horizon, the singularity, instead of being attractive, becomes repulsive, forcing the traveler along the edge of the wormhole and out the other edge of the torus ... in either the past, or an alternate universe. Thus it becomes perfectly possible to cross four event horizons and emerge in a different universe provided one does not attempt to cross the singularity in the process. The video ended with Skeptical Type looking both excited and nervous. Watching Arjun's videos? said 116. He sounded amused. Did he tell you about the singularity being temporal? Or the negative space? Or did he do his talking-to-a-ten-year-old thing again? There's a lot to be said for simplifying things, said Rohan, feeling satisfied with what he'd learned. 116 made a noise like a grunt. He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, he said. None of us do. It's all quantum and Einstein's shit doesn't work anymore. Have you ever heard of Li-Xin Li? No. Again that short bark of a laugh. Li wrote a paper that solved the Lorentzian wormhole problem perfectly, 116 said. Satisfied Einstein's equations perfectly. Beautiful math. Too goddamn bad it's probably all bullshit. POSSIBLE THEORIES FOR THE POINT OF ARRIVAL, read the next entry in the list. Rohan decided to watch it later. He summoned the space view. It's getting redder, he said. Why is it blue at the corner? 116 was silent for a moment. We're getting close, he said.

In the days that followed, the spearhead hurtled silently towards the black hole. One ship suffered a catastrophic failure that activated the secondary engines on the side and sent it veering sideways, tumbling and spinning until it developed its own internal gravity. The inhabitant, a beautiful 32-year old doctor from Moscow, died screaming under the immense g-forces. Her pair-partner, lost in the silence with the doctor's screams ringing in his ears, masturbated to a photo of her and took his own life out of sheer boredom. One passenger refused to eat, staring at the Eye and whispering fragments of poetry towards it, eventually dying of hunger. His partner, when notified by her Ship, briefly paused her morning yoga and made a small sacrifice of meal in his name. After an hour's consideration, she ate the offering. The dead man's Ship carried on, resolute in the way that only machines could be, while his corpse floated cross-legged in front of the space view. And thus the spearhead carried on, taking with it life, death, love, lust, anger, envy, joy, indifference, and all the other things that make us human. And Rohan Wijeratne found some semblance of peace. It started with the little things. His world, once a vast and chaotic muddle laced with alcohol and tipped with the poisoned barbs of society, narrowed down to a few things. Routine. Diet. Exercise. His daily conversations with Ship, which were always polite, both of them secure in their roles of impotent master and godlike slave. In this universe there were only two things that changed; the Eye and 116. You know the funny thing about black holes? What? They're the simplest things in this goddamn universe, he said. Simpler than stars, simpler than planets, certainly simpler than human fucking beings. Rohan ignored him. It does look like the eye of God from here, he whispered. MAXIMUM POLARIZATION, Ship said quietly. The Eye took up a large chunk of his space view now. There was the great ring; white fire, arcing from heaven to earth, growing redder and redder as it disappeared. And inside it, ominous, was that lake of perfect black. A black so pure and perfect it didn't belong in this universe. It seemed to follow him. Was he dreaming, or was it very slightly lopsided? God isn't real, said the astrophysicist. Unless you're stupid enough to believe in him. It was lopsided. The fucking Eye was bent towards one corner. Rohan smiled for the first time in ages. He raised an imaginary glass to the Eye that stared at him through the darkness. You should have stayed at Mintage, he said to it. That prawn toast was the only perfect thing You made. In his mind's eye, he imagined God smiling ruefully, drinking from His own Glass, refilling it with all the water in the universe.

WARNING: APPROACHING ERGOSPHERE Rohan jolted awake. Red lights flashed around the creche. He rushed out into the living room. The ring of fire now stretched almost entirely across the screen. The edges shimmered, like a mirror gone bad. He could barely see the stars now. One edge of it glowed fiercely. The Eye swallowed up his whole view, a horribly bloated blackness. FALSE-COLOR RENDERING ENABLED DUE TO GAMMA RADIATION, Ship told him. EXECUTING UNSTABLE ORBIT. 116? MATCHING SPIN, said Ship. 116! he shouted. I'm here, said 116. Oh. Crap. Is it that time already? Hold on . . . .shit shit shit shit shit Rohan held on. After weeks of floating, his body felt surprisingly heavy. Something seemed to be pushing him towards the back and left of the ship. The ring of fire shimmered, expanded, and then fire wrapped around them. The ship shuddered violently. For a brief second the Eye was at the far corner of a cocoon made of light. Shit shit shit shit Then something corrected itself and they were in the fire, which was curiously distorted and blurred; the darkness grew and grew, all-encompassing. Rohan felt panic rising in his throat. It felt like falling. There was a whisper of noise, a kind of low-key throaty roar, that seemed to come from all around them - The Eye suddenly shifted to one side, a wall of emptiness on his left, and the fire returned. It gave him the curious feeling of being turned inside-out. UNSTABLE ORBIT ACHIEVED, said Ship. My God, it's full of stars, croaked 116. Where? Just having a Clarke moment, said 116. He laughed nervously. You know, I know these damn things can survive half-light speed, but for a second there ... you okay? Rohan checked. The Ship shuddered from time to time. He was surprised to find that he was trembling. We're in a place where space time spins around with Eye, said 116. The first event horizon is just past this. We're not staying here long. PHASE TWO INITIATION IN TWENTY SECONDS, said Ship. My God, 116 said again. I thought you didn't believe in God, said Rohan, trying to make a joke out of it. His voice came out in a hoarse whisper. Well, said 116. Nobody believes, but everybody prays anyway. PHASE TWO INITIATING, said Ship. The darkness swept over them.

To those watching - and even then, there still were a few hopefuls who watched the signals from the Eye, telescopes eagerly trained on the singularity - the spearhead lit up in brilliant green, faint among the stars, but detectable to the telescopes that stared hungrily out at the cosmos. Simulations, marvelously life-like, played out in screens across Tokyo, New York, London, and Mumbai, showing the brave adventurers as they curved gracefully around the Eye of God. Perhaps the ships on the screens looked a lot newer than the real ones - what did that matter? The world paused to watch the thirty-six brave souls who dared fly into a black hole, into the Eye of God itself. O God, our heavenly Father, whose glory fills the whole creation, whispered a preacher, his flock forgotten. God, whose presence we find wherever we go: preserve those who travel; surround them with your loving care; protect them from every danger; and bring them in safety to their journey's end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. I place your religion, your faithfulness and the ends of your deeds in the trust of Allah, said the Muslim woman next to him. May Allah endow you with taqwaa, forgive your sins and facilitate all good for you, wherever you be. Amen, said the man of Christ. Ameen, said the woman of Muhammed. They watched as the ships arced lazily towards the darkness, slowing down as they approached, eventually coming to a full stop just at the outer edge and slowly vanishing. We're told that the ships have officially passed beyond the event horizon, said the elaborately coiffed news anchor, her smile sparkling brighter than the stars. We have with us Dr. Arjun Gunasakeram, who's been with the Titor Project since its inception . . . And old man appeared on the screen, bright eyes buried in wasted, drooping flesh. The people of religion shook their heads and walked away, their prayers sent, giving way to the man of science on the big screen.

UNSTABLE ORBIT ACHIEVED. VIEWFINDER PROCESS FAILED, said Ship in the darkness. It sounded apologetic. The lights came on. Everything looked normal. Table. Chair. Walls.You there? said Rohan. A hiss. All present and ready, said 116's voice, slightly slower than normal. Looks like we entered right as planned. Just along the edge. You're not supposed to feel anything when you enter the event horizon. VIEWFINDER PROCESS FAILED, repeated Ship. Rohan cursed. What's it like? I can't see shit here. Hold on, said 116. Whoa. Wow. What's it like? You ever taken acid in a hall of mirrors? VIEWFINDER PROCESS REBOOTED. And then there was light. Half of Rohan's space view exploded in a swirl of colors. To the right, the ergosphere, bent and splayed out completely wrong, and to his left, a sea of black, a sea that curved from one end of the screen to the other, rimmed with dull red light in front of a second ... blackness, he thought, and immediately corrected himself. He couldn't understand what he saw. It was a distortion, a warping, a pit that his eyes refused to process, lit at the edges by the river of dull red leaking from the edge of the sea they surfed. For some strange reason he couldn't pinpoint where it was, exactly. I think that's the inner horizon, said 116, speaking slowly now. Hey, you alright? You're giggling like a schoolgirl. Thirty-five years in space, frozen. The combined efforts of humanity's best minds. All for the world's greatest acid trip. Rohan laughed. Snap out of it, said 116 slowly, sounding annoyed. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE INNER AND OUTER SURFACES OF THE RING IS ESTIMATED AT TWO HUNDRED KILOMETERS, said Ship. THOUGH IT HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR SPEED. REFERENCE POINTS INSIDE THIS ZONE CANNOT BE TAKEN AS ACCURATE. So I guess we can't snap out of it, said Rohan, hooting just a little. He swiveled to look at the door to the front part of the ship, which now blinked in soft amber. Silence. Fuck, man, lighten up, said Rohan. You made it, didn't you? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Why the fuck aren't you happy? I am happy, said 116. There's just a fine line between being happy and being fucking hysterical. Silence. Besides, we're human, said 116, as if trying to lighten things up. We're not meant to be happy. Saying it slower doesn't make it true, said Rohan, staring intently at that soft amber door. Wait, what? Rohan got up and padded over to the door. It swung open without protest. Do I sound slow? said 116. Yes, said Rohan, flipping a switch that read Manual. Fuck. Why? asked Rohan, flipping a switch that read Safety. Because you sound slower as well. Rohan paused, his fingers poised over the old, familiar keyboard. Why? You're moving faster into the black hole, said 116. You must a little bit ahead of me. The gravity on you is stronger. The Doppler shift is kicking in. Shit. Shit. Shit. I thought we were going in together. Does it matter? You're going to be pulled away from me, said 116, and something in his voice said panic. We're going to be alone. Silence. Did I ever tell you why I ended up in this gig? Ah. The small talk. Unlike the laws of physics, the laws that govern small talk are constant everywhere in the universe. Why? Stephen Hawking, said 116. Old guy in a wheelchair, famous physicist? Anyway. Cambridge man, right? Guy finds out at the age of 21 that he has a disease called ALS. Basically, his muscles are going to stop responding one by one. Doesn't stop him. Ends up with a Ph.D., chairing the same position that Isaac Newton himself. Fathers three kids. Writes the first real theory on unifying relativity and quantum mechanics. You know what he said? He said the universe began in a singularity. You know what he also said? Two shots of arrack and Sprite make the perfect cocktail? said Rohan, distracted. He said if we ever discovered a unified theory for how the universe works, one single perfect system, we'd know the mind of God, finished 116 dramatically. So all of this is to tell me you're looking for God in a black hole instead of a church? When you put it that way, said 116. Rohan made his way to the creche. The glass box, rimmed with steel, opened up for him. He folded himself into it. Little straps and things hung from the sides; these he dug out from underneath him, the gray memory foam molding itself to his body. The space view slid up gently on the glass chamber. One-half of it was that surreal ocean of blackness; the other showed 116, his too-white face tilted back in contemplation. It was comfortable. It would do. What's really on the other side of that horizon? he asked idly, running his hands over the little straps, connecting things to other things meant to receive them. Some say it's a different universe, said 116. His voice sounded terribly slow now, and deeper than normal. Some say there's a white hole on the other side that'll spit you out at the speed of light. Some say we might end up in a mirror universe. Or even a negative space . . .truth is, nobody has any idea. I don't know. I just ... I don't know. Do you think we'll make it? I think we're going to die, said 116. Rohan smiled in the glass box and pressed a button. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? asked Ship. Yes, said Rohan Wijeratne. I've always wanted to do this. A red light blinked on. The airlock hissed. There was a roar, like a guttural beast, like God himself growling in anger. The world tumbled, spun, shrunk, galaxies collapsing into a single crystal ball. Rohan floated, for one brief second, a lone microbe stranded at the edge of the iris of the Eye of God. A part of him felt terribly heavy. The darkness swallowed him whole. But what was that? The black sea was shrinking. Fast. Faster. A ring, a thick film of white fire that became starlight, shimmering around a pupil of black. The Eye stared at him again. And in its depths, a pinprick of light, a bubble glowing in the darkness, a bubble that reached out to the edges of the shrinking blackness, throwing everything out of itself - space, time, light. Now they swapped roles; the black ring, orbiting a supernova of white that bulged and burnt out the darkness. Rohan screamed, part terror, part pain, as his body, entombed in glass and steel, accelerated to just near lightspeed. A memory - or was it a dream? - flashed through his dying mind: Mintage. Hard wood, the scent of arrack and cigarette smoke, and the noise of misery, buried beneath one more conversation, one more drink. Faces, faces. And in one corner, just beneath the naked light, an old man, immaculately dressed, clutching his glass, staring at the scratches on the table, the marks of a hundred drunk poets, lovers, and drunkards. The old man looked up and met Rohan’s eyes. Let there be light, he whispered. And a new universe exploded into being.

# **Footnotes:**

The name ‘the Titor Project’ is derived from the infamous John Titor hoax, a practical joke played out in the early 2000s by someone claiming to be a time traveler from the year 2036. Titor was very specific, predicting a future where the United States had split into five, even going to the extent of sharing blueprints of his time machine. A Bussard Ramjet is a theoretical method of spacecraft propulsion proposed in 1960 by the physicist Robert W. Bussard. I remember it because of all the Larry Niven books I read. It uses enormous electromagnetic fields (ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter) to collect and compress hydrogen from the interstellar medium. We’re not using it right now because it turns out the interstellar medium in the Solar System contains a lot less of the star-stuff than we need, but in regions of slightly higher density, this might just work. Space has a whole lot of radiation that doesn’t bode well for the human body. In a 2012 paper by NASA, Francis A. Cucinotta, Myung-Hee Y. Kim and Lori J. Chappell confirmed that liquid hydrogen might be the best protection - hence the inner shell of the ship around Rohan’s living quarters. The red shifting of light, and 116’s ever-increasing slowness of voice are both symptoms of the Doppler shift effect. Electromagnetic waves (light, radio) change frequency as they move towards or away from you. This is why sirens get higher pitches as the ambulance rushes towards you. The same effect is used to measure the speed at which interstellar objects (like galaxies) are moving away from us: the redder they are, the faster they’re going. The same applies for light coming towards the spaceships and light moving away from the spaceships, which is why the black hole’s ergosphere would appear blue in one corner and red in the other. The black hole in question is a Kerr singularity. Theoretically, it is possible for a black hole to rotate such that it creates a torus in space-time, possibly connecting up to four universes together, as seen in [the Carter-Penrose diagram below](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Carter-Penrose-diagram-of-Kerr-black-hole_fig7_341509361):

To date, the most accurate public depiction of such a black hole would be … Interstellar. I owe a debt of gratitude to astrophysicist Kip Thorne, who explained a great many things about how a black hole would appear to the naked eye, to astronomer David Darling ([www.daviddarling.info](http://www.daviddarling.info/)) for his discussion of Kerr black holes, to Andrew Hamilton for his visual exploration of a journey into a Reissner-Nordström black hole ([http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/rn.html](http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/rn.html)), and to Dr Ikjyot Singh Kohli ([www.relativitydigest.com](http://www.relativitydigest.com/)) for their discussion tidal forces around the Kerr black hole from Interstellar. Many thanks to Nisansa Dilushan De Silva, Pamudu Tennakoon and Marianne David, who helped greatly with ironing out the typos in the first versions. And lastly, people look for God in odd places. I’m an atheist myself. But there is a chance we’ll die and it’ll turn out I’m wrong. If I am wrong, please ask Him/Her/It why the bread always lands jam side down.
