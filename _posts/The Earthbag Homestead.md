## Synopsis

I’m retiring from life in Colombo to my dream of a writer’s cottage in the mountains. The location is Kandy, Sri Lanka. This is retirement by the age of 30; sans rent, expensive electricity utilities, growing our own food; it will make it so much easier for me to focus on creative work. This is the (Mostly) Benevolent Dictatorship of Wijeratne.

## Progress

25/12/2022

Initial plans are done. We’ve moved away from the original A-frame longhouse-style design to something a little more spacious and complex, following the curve of the land. This means a lot more work on retaining walls but ultimately a far more elegant solution with better workspaces.

Alright, we have roads. By roads I mean we have a 100 ft stretch set on what was once the most dangerous stretch to the property. The rest will have to stay as an earth road; maybe I can grow some grass (something that grows fast in these climates) to carpet the road and bind the earth together to prevent erosion. On the list of things to do.

Where do we start? The land has wildly overgrown since we saw it last. Right now it’s a veritable rainforest covered with elephant grass. The roads there have largely dissolved with rain and neglect (fuel crisis of 2022 has made it nearly impossible to repair these by hand). Surrounding lots have fallen into disrepair and rot. Of the problems, the worst is leeches, which we will have to deal with.

We’ve commissioned a road to fix some of the more difficult bits. Concrete, expensive, but with this it should be possible to get vehicles up and down to the land without falling off the mountain altogether.

While we’re going back on forth on planning, I’ve been shopping. The DIY farm equipment arrived! The computer room is now chock full of drills, bits of metal, nails, hammers, and pretty much everything I could think of by studying r/permaculture and r/woodworking on Reddit.

I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of using drones for surveying and helping design the landscape. Initial experiments have failed. DJI drones are expensive, but the more McGyver solution is just weak.

On the plus side, I’ve gained a lot more knowledge around drone manufacturing and supply chains, camera manufacturing and supply chains, camera angles, video recording, and have built up a collection of gear for The Mostly Benevolent Dictatorship of Wijeratne.

Farming project got much more serious. Ishan at Appendix brought up the idea of logging our farm data in a wiki. We call this the Apocalypse Garden project. Tineeka began to compile databases of seedstock, and I began to catalogue permaculture guilds and optimisations in tropical countries (including water retention and irrigation).  Lots here to learn, but doable.

While working on charting the collapse of agriculture in Sri Lanka via Appendix/Watchdog , Tineeka and I came across ‘Fools and Dreamers’ by Happen Films:

This stuck with us and took us down the rabbit hole of permaculture Youtube. We decided to grow our own food - and with food supply in Sri Lanka tumbling, that made it seem the right decision. Maybe the world does need a few more fools and dreamers in it.

The contour planning and measurements are done. Top is Navin and Thilani; bottom is us.

We’ve engaged the services of Vishwa (a good friend and fellow geek) as architect for the project and finalized the land sale.

## Seed

When I was 15 I decided that I would one day build a cottage somewhere far away and fuck off into a world where I didn’t have to worry about rent. I had Rs 200 in my account. My back-of-the-school-notebook projections were to hit this phase by the time I was 55. By the end of 2019, I had enough to buy 186 perches (1.16 acres) of mountainside in Kandy. Thanks to my writing, I’ve been able to beat my own deadline by 25 years, with house money to spare.

Finding land was an exercise in frustration and some good lessons about land scams. Navin, Thilani and I went halfway across Sri Lanka before ultimately settling on Kandy: it fit the criteria we needed - climate proofing for up to 2 Celsius rise, lower humidity and less smog (more breathable air than in Colombo), plus easy access to hospitals and transport.

The initial plan was to build a house with earthbags.

I had three constrains to think of:

Cost.

Sustainability.

A genuine loathing of concrete cubes.

I think I went through practically every earthbag house video on YouTube, as well as the logs on The Mud Home. Then I got more serious: exploring modern engineering and architecture as well as ancient. Useful jump-off points were the work of Nader Khalili at CalEarth, [Guedelon Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%C3%A9delon_Castle), as well as Middle Eastern architectural features that I had first seen in Tunisia, [such as wind towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher).
