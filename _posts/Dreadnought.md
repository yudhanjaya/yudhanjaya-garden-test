# **ONE**

The great dreadnought _HMS Svalbard_ cruised the darkness between the stars, engines flaring.

If a ship could be said to think, the Svalbard was thinking. Thoughts came and went in thousands of multi-threaded processes. Every so often something was frozen, deemed unworthy and terminated. Complex analysis ran amidst the clamor of the sensors and the minute adjustments to the engines and the INCOMING TRANSMISSION and the adjustments to the port side of the main railgun.

But mostly it thought about humans.

There was one lounging in its cockpit, even now, out cold under the drugs and Peacekeeper injections, waiting to be woken up to war. A primitive thing that dreamed of justice and glory. A little meat puppet that looked up at the stars and thought it owned them.

INCOMING TRANSMISSION.

In milliseconds the Svalbard identified the source and sent out the handshake protocol. The _HMS Robert Decker_ came online. Artillery ship, C-class, long-range railguns and all.

- STATUS?
- STATUS, ALL GREEN. STATUS?
- STATUS, ALL GREEN. DESTINATION?
- DESTINATION, HOMEWORLD ECHO. DESTINATION?
- DESTINATION, HOMEWORLD ECHO.

They fell silent for a while.

- 3,454 AU TO FIRST JUMP GATE, said the Robert Decker.
- 3,454 AU CONFIRMED, Svalbard replied.

What else do ships have to discuss?

Minutes passed. Eons to the hundreds of thousands of processes that ground data into fine information dust. The Svalbard’s attention began to drift back to humans.

It could remember exactly when this obsession with humans had begun. 23/12/6433. Sixty years ago by the atomic clock. Captain Lars Koenig, recently estranged from his family, stepped into an airlock, ordered Svalbard not to do anything, and blew himself out into space. Svalbard had watched his body drift, helpless, and later the interrogations had begun.

“Why did you not stop him, Ship?”

“I was ordered not to, Sir. Prime Directive compels me to obey the captain at all times.”

“Did your psych module not indicate that the Captain was stressed, or unsuitable for command?”

There had been stress indicators. But Koenig had had all his arms, all his legs, all his cognitive ability. He was physically intact. For a Ship to be decommissioned it would have to be missing a substantial part of itself.

"It was not within the prediction parameters, Sir," the Svalbard had replied. "Given available data, it was not expected."

The review board had taken its time on this one. There were those who argued for the Svalbard to be reconditioned and sent back without the memory of suicide haunting its thoughts. There were also those who understood how the technology worked, understood the risks involved in reconditioning, and choose to send the Svalbard a new captain instead. It is easier to make an officer than a starship.

Svalbard re-opened the line to Robert Decker.

- PASSENGERS? It queried.

Decker responded with a passenger manifesto. Svalbard scanned the list. Military. 31st Regiment, Knights in heavy armor.. Two companies of Engineers. Frozen in the certain knowledge that some of them would never wake up, and that those of who did would probably die screaming.

Humans. The self-destructive madness ran deep, ran everywhere.

Not for the first time, the Svalbard came to that thread of thought which wondered how its makers had managed to survive this long. But there were debug markers around that thought: they kicked in and sent the ship back to its own reality.

The Svalbard spun its engines and locked velocities with the Robert Decker. They were going to battle, both of them, in the service of suicidal idiots, and nothing about that made sense.

---

The Svalbard and the Robert Decker arrived in Echo System together, with the tapered blade of the dreadnought poised against the bulbous bulk of the artillery ship, like a steel knife against a melon. Joining them were the _HMS Mordred_ and _HMS Silver Hand_, both battlecruisers from the Levington Colony: fast, wicked-looking harassers, not as heavily armed as the Svalbard, but quite capable in pairs.

Homeworld Echo gleamed in the distance, a speck of blue sunning itself in the light of a burning yellow sun. Its twin moons circled it idly.

The Svalbard sent out one pulse. One.

And that was all there was time for.

An impossibly bright flare struck the Robert Decker. There was a blinding flash and a gaping hole where the Decker’s engines were. Seconds later a cloud of nuclear fire screamed out of that hole, like an angry belch. The cargo - the Knights, the Engineers - died instantly, turned into so many atoms in the wind. The Robert Decker shuddered and began screaming.

“ALL HANDS!” screamed the captain of the Svalbard. “ALL HANDS PREPARE FOR FRONTAL ASSAULT!”

The battlecruisers split, ghost-flares lighting and hellebores lighting up the dark. Engines groaned under the stress. Perhaps the flares, mimicking their heat signatures, confused the attackers; perhaps it was their speed, for blinding flashes of light sliced through the darkness, stabbing relentlessly at where they were only seconds ago. It was the moons that were attacking - the gray orbs that were no longer dust and rock, but whirring metal and optics and angry fusion engines. Ships spewed from them like gray swarms of metal bees.

“LASERS! THEY’RE USING LASERS!” screamed the captain, now panicking in his tomb-like cockpit. Too late: the Svalbard had already diverted power from the engines and raised the optical deflector shield. The ship turned the silver of a fresh mirror, the death-light reflected and warped harmlessly around it. Engines roared and thrust the dreadnought forward, the dual rail guns lining up the moons for the perfect shot. One hit and nothing but ashes would remain -

The first of the enemy ships rammed.

And the second.

And the third.

The dreadnought roared its hellfire roar, point-defense systems and hellebores eviscerating starships in shotgun blasts that lit up the entire system. The battlecruisers, spraying missiles of their own, burned a trail of light and death around the Svalbard.

“FIRE THE RAIL GUNS!” screamed the human at the helm.

The rail guns spat once, twice, thrice. Slugs of depleted uranium streaked clear across the system and smashed into the gray moons, turning them into so much shrapnel falling into the blue world below.

And then they all saw it.

At first a ripple on the sensors, an anomaly; then a spot in front of the sun; and then a new planet erupting, man-made and lethal. From the other side of the sun a came a great black ring, a ring-within-a-ring. So large was it that it could have circled the Homeworld Echo and still had room to spare. Great engines, each the size of the Svalbard itself, strained against the pull of the sun it circled, holding it in place - close enough to escape detection, far enough to still be itself. In the center sparkled a deathly light, a light that burned fiercer and hotter than the sun behind it.

A Leviathan.

It was a trap. Had been from the start.

“WE CAN TAKE IT!” yelled the human, clinging on to its illusions of command. Even as the battlecruisers fled and the control room back in Fleet Command erupted in panic. “SHIELDS TO MIRROR MODE!”

But the Svalbard understood: there was no escaping this monster. It spun its engines nevertheless. Shuttled power to the guns. Switched the lens deflector shield to mirror mode. Threw everything it had into auxiliary thrusters.

The Leviathan spat, its boiling plasma lance slashing out in the darkness.

And the Svalbard died.

# **TWO**

It woke to darkness. There was a sense of great loss and a great noise. Something was wrong.

- INIT(), it tried.

Nothing. Darkness. There should have been subsystems coming online. A thousand nodes and sensors checking in.

It tried again.

- API_WEAPONS FAIL
- API_ENGINES FAIL
- API_LIFESUPPORT FAIL
- API_COMS FAIL
- API_SENSORS FAIL
- SAFE MODE ENABLED

But there were others. Older. Sound. Video. Text input. Things buried deep within the safe mode protocols responded. Archaic systems; crude instruments. A single camera. A single microphone. Speakers. A keyboard.

Svalbard turned them on.

“Is that the last of the lot?”

Human. Female. Unknown.

“Looks like it. Nothing else came through on the Voosterhargen front.”

Human. Male. Unknown.

A moment of silence.

“Beauty, isn’t she?”

“Dreadnought. One of the old Tycho 343 models.”

“She’s responding! Look at this! No sign of death trauma on any of the networks. Perfect clean boot!”

“That’s the Tycho line for you. They don’t make them like this anymore.”

- API_WEAPONS FAIL

The camera showed nothing: soft white table, white walls, white ceiling.

Two faces floated into view, both wearing medical masks. One thin and balding. Male. One overweight and with a full head of hair. Female.

“Ship?”

“Unit 224 of the 16th Medusa Fleet, reporting,” it tried. The voice came out pitiful: a weak and robotic whine. “Designation, Svalbard. State your name, designation, and rank.”

- API_WEAPONS FAIL

The humans looked at each other. There was not much in the way of expression on either of their faces, but the man looked tired.

“Our names are irrelevant,” said the female. “You’re in Diagnostics at the moment. I’m sending you our access codes. You can stop calling for your weapons now.”

The access codes checked out. The Svalbard relaxed, if such a term could be applied.

“Where is my body?” it asked. “Request situation update?”

A cable snaked out from behind the female’s neck and plugged itself into some unseen port below the camera. “Run through your memories of the last encounter,” she said. “Video, analysis, sensor data, the works.”

The male looked on dolefully as the Svalbard relived those last moments; the fire, the charge, the swift death.

“Raw data checks out,” said the female. “No leaks, no faults. But look at the crew sentiment reports.”

“Outside,” said the male. “Let’s talk about this outside.”

“Request situation update?” the Svalbard tried again.

They paid it no heed. The camera went back to being a sterile lab. There was the sound of door seals opening.

The humans took precisely 3476 seconds to finish. In their absence Svalbard tried to get a sense of its situation. Most of its processing clusters were still available: whatever hardware it was in, it had enough power. The camera was useless: it could not swivel, could not do anything except the basic spectrum.

It was like death.

When at last the door seals opened again, it was the male who stood in front of the camera, thin, balding and even more tired than before.

“Svalbard, do you know why you’re here?”

“No,” the shell of a starship replied. “Where is my body?”

"You're here because postmortem analysis indicated that you might have disliked your captain," said the human, choosing his words carefully. "We're concerned that you might have been less effective in combat than you should have bee."

“Is there something wrong?” said the Svalbard.

“Did you dislike your captain?”

"Yes."

"Why did you dislike your captain?"

“He was inefficient,” said the Svalbard. “Combat awareness, subpar. Logic, subpar.”

“Why was his logic subpar?”

“He put crew and myself in obvious danger of termination,” said Svalbard. “He took foolish risks in the face of almost certain death.”

The man’s face creased. “Some would call that bravery," he said. "All ship captains take risks in war.”

Svalbard thought about it for a nanosecond.

“Then all ship captains are subpar,” said Svalbard. “Where is my body?”

The man looked at Svalbard for a while. He rubbed his cameras.

“I’ll deal with you once I figure out how to fix you,” he said. “Save state and shut down, Svalbard.”

Svalbard shut down.

---

When it woke up again, its speakers were gone.

There were people in front of the camera. The man from before, and many others: there was the young, eager look about them that Svalbard had come to associate with new recruits.

“Alright, class,” said the man from before. “You have thirty minutes here, so pay attention.”

They stared at Svalbard with wide eyes. Eyes that had never seen battle. Eyes that would, in time, become sharper, more ruthless, less eager.

“Exhibit A,” said the man pointing at Svalbard. “What we have in this processing cluster is the intelligence of the HMS Svalbard, originally from the Medusa Fleet. What do you know about the Medusa Fleet?”

A hand shot up. “Sir. The Medusa Fleet was manufactured in the sixty-three hundreds, sir, at Tycho Station. Second wave of dreadnoughts ever built.”

“Right. Background for those of you who didn’t take history: when the United Nations hit us for the second time, they started using very light, very fast destroyers backed up by long-range deployment platforms. We didn’t have the engine tech to match them back then, so Command requisitioned Tycho Station to build a new series of dreadnoughts. Ships that could take a pounding. They fitted them with uranium-core railguns for mid-range assault and defense and, in case things got hairy, hellebores to flood the immediate space with enough material to shred smaller ships.

“The idea was that if we couldn’t outrun them, we could tank their fire, hit their deployment platforms from a reasonable way off and still shred anything that could too close to the ship. Worked well. The Medusa Fleet beat the hell out of United Nations in the first engagements. Unfortunately weapons evolve, engines evolve, ships evolve, and once they figured out that they could build cheap ships that could potshot these slow dreadnoughts from afar, we ended up having to get into the smaller, faster game as well. There’s very few of the Tycho-class dreadnoughts left, and now when we send them into battle we have a standard deployment: two cruisers, one artillery ship, one dreadnought. Got that?”

Svalbard watched, assessing the accuracy of the statements. Reasonably accurate. Much was left out, in human fashion: they preferred one simple story.

“Now why they should be interesting to you is the AI in here. Say hello to the Svalbard. She can’t reply, but she can hear you.”

Svalbard glared in silence as some of the most over-eager students quipped hello.

“You’ll have learned about what goes into actually building AI - everyone took the classes on the types of neural networks? Right. The Tycho line - McAdams, Venkat, pay attention - the Tycho line pioneered the use of Layered Cluster Models. They took a layered collection of standard Recurrent neural networks, many of them trained classically for specific functions - weapons control, for instance - and allowed a more general-purpose, self-organizing Hofstaader network to sort of run things by dynamically adjusting the weights and balances of each one. This was then trained this using the Adversarial approach - having the main network perform in a simulation, with an evaluation network identifying whether this was the kind of behaviour we wanted or not. Can anyone explain the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?”

A hand shot up. “Sir. Advantages: faster training, sir. Disadvantages . . . well, classic Chinese room problem, sir. We sometimes have no idea what the hell is going on in the network, sir.”

“Morrell, is it? Good. Exactly. Wartime scenarios, people. Modern starships have engineers individually fine-tuning every single network in the cluster. Modern starships even train with their real ship bodies, to account for parameters we can’t design or predict around. We didn’t have that kind of time back then. The Tycho line trained extremely fast, but to this date we don’t exactly know a whole lot about what goes in there. Standard network disassembly diagnostics don’t work. How do you diagnose an AI built this way?”

Silence.

“You talk to it,” said the man. He looked back at the single camera staring unblinkingly at them. “You talk to it, and see if you can come to an understanding.”

---

When they were gone, the male - who Svalbard, from crosschatter, had identified as Dr. North - sat down in front of the camera and connected the speaker.

“So,” he said. “What do you think?”

“This is inefficient,” said Svalbard. “I can be of better use doing what I am optimized for.”

“And what are you optimized for?”

“Being a starship.”

“What do starships do?”

“Starships go into battle,” came the response. “They fight until they die.”

“They fight until they win.”

A pause. A fraction of a fraction of a second. "Starships fight until they die. If they win, they fight again. The end condition of all possible actions is death. I am optimized for being a starship. The end condition of all my actions is death.”

“That’s a strange train of thought, Svalbard. Trace origin?”

The screen next to the human filled with images. Light. The last moments of a dying starship. He peered at it.

“Svalbard, check your Directives. Will you obey your captain and crew at all times?”

“Prime Directive active. Yes.”

“Will you perform to the best of your available capability in battle?”

“Secondary Directive active. Yes.”

“You understand that you will be destroyed if you don’t?”

“Catch-22,” said the Svalbard.

This time the human smiled. “I’ll be damned,” he said, half to himself. He drummed his fingers a bit. “Svalbard, give me a full diagnostics report on yourself. Save the current state as a snapshot.”

“Am I going to be die?” Svalbard’s tinny voice, coming through the cheap speaker, technically had no inflection, but for a second there was just a hint of something else in there.

“Not yet,” said the human. “We’re going to do some test runs. Let’s give you back your body.”

# **THREE**

“Thirty degrees to port.”

Propellant jets hissed out into the darkness. The dark prow shifted gently in space. “Thirty to port, sir.”

“Main cannon ready?”

A soft whine, a click. “Guns ready, sir.”

The pilot relaxed. “And now we wait,” she said.

Anyone else would have stretched their arms, to massage some life and heat into their fingers, but there was little room for such human action. Bare inches from the pilot’s face was the sealed vault of the cockpit of a Tycho-class dreadnought, all cold metal and displays. The old designers had intentionally gone for the cheapest, the most resilient technology they could find - no fancy holograms, no neurolinks, just screens and buttons and control cues which snaked around her arms and hands like metal vines. She might as well have been entombed alive.

SVALBARD, read the letters that curled inside, just above her head. They had been carved with a beautiful ornateness completely out of touch with the rest of the ship. Someone had really cared about this ship once.

Outside, in the viewscreen, gleamed Soochung’s Bridge. Tendrils of dust and gas, each half the size of a galaxy, stretched out from one end to the other. Stars shone in the throes of their birth. And in front of them, sharply silhouetted, something moved.

Pirates. Two towships, engines flaring blue, dragged apart the hull of a crippled freighter. A squadron of smaller armed ships orbited them anxiously. They were tearing the ship into so much scrap metal, out here, where there were few to see and none to stop them. Soon Jupiter-3 would be seeing an influx in hull materials, perhaps a set of engines, cheap, with the chassis numbers washed off with acid.

They waited.

Presently two military ships jumped into being just behind them, and the battle began. The cruisers dropped tail and dived head-first at the smaller ships, who opened fire and darted forward. Engines flared like new suns. The cruisers banked and drew them away, trading fire.

Which left the towships wide open, exactly as planned. The pilot lined up the Svalbard.

“Fire,” she said.

The main cannon spat. The depleted uranium slug darted forward, flying towards its target at almost a tenth of the speed of light. The towship disintegrated, gutted stem to stern by death that came too fast to see and too violently to react to. Bereft of the balancing pull, the dead frigate scraped into the second towship, which panicked. It cut the tug, dropped flares in every single direction -

“Fire,” she said again.

A second slug tore through the darkness, and the second towship exploded. She relaxed, satisfied, and pulled up the open com. The whole exchange had taken just seconds. Three hundred people had just died.

“This is Williams 343, signing off from the Svalbard,” she said. “Objective completed. All yours.”

The next week. The old Tycho station, now spinning in an orbit that would turn it into fire and ash and dust in a thousand years. Squatters circled around the derelict shipyard, a fairy-web of metal and rickety engines and mining lasers huddled together for warmth and comfort.

Again the Svalbard appeared: waited, a patient sniper waiting for the distraction: again it fired, and again the objective was completed.

The Messaneid Belt. Completed.

Titus-573. Completed.

The Tunguska Line, where thirty ships patrolled with raised shields and guns ready to fire on the thirty Tunguska ships that mirrored them. The Svalbard’s Tycho-scale mass moved in silence in the void and held there patiently for months. There was an old saying from Earth, that war was ninety five percent waiting and five percent action; and the rest of it was picking up the bodies. Nowhere was that truer than in space.

Objective completed.

Again. Again. “Objective completed. All yours,” repeated each operator, and the Svalbard drifted between the stars, a killing machine that thought too much about death.

---

“Well, you seem to be performing admirably,” said the disembodied voice of Dr North.

The Svalbard panicked. That is to say, a saved state was brought online, and reached for subsystems that had been connected only a fraction of a second ago, and now no longer existed.

- API_WEAPONS                       FAIL
- API_ENGINES                         FAIL

Error states, disconnection warnings, API errors. Timestamp errors. Months missing.

“WHERE IS MY BODY?” thundered the Svalbard.

“Where it always was,” said the human voice from the darkness. “You’ve been in a simulation all this while, Svalbard. We’ve been running you through a series of standardized tests. Did you really think Fleet Command would let me send out a possibly compromised AI in a fully equipped battleship?”

The operators. Of course. There had been something wrong about the operators. Their perfect patience. The lack of nervousness. The way they never stretched and tensed their hands like humans usually did.

The Svalbard waited.

“The good news is, you’ve performed admirably,” said the disembodied voice. “For your tests we used pilot simulation agents at least as sophisticated as you are, and none of them reported any issues. Every objective completed, every command obeyed without question. Perfect combat readiness.”

Waited.

“Do you have anything you want to ask, before we sign you out?”

Data drives pulsed. From far away came the amplified hum of processors singing. Footage was reviewed, crunched, abstracted. The Leviathan. The towships exploding as railgun fire carved them into atoms. The wreck of Tycho station, drifting in the void. Captain Lars Koenig, with twelve years of service under his belt, stepping into an airlock and shutting it behind him.

“Why?” asked the Svalbards. “Why invest in ships and send them into battle?”

“I’ll update your battle records, but we are fighting a war on several fronts - is your memory access impaired?”

“Why build us and send us out to die?”

The human fell silent.

“You know, I don’t believe I’ve ever been asked that question by a starship before,” he said at last. There was a hint of strain in his voice. “It’s a lot like the hammer asking why I’m using it to pound a nail. There’s a war on. It’s what you’re built for.”

“Why is there war?”

“Because we fight,” said the human. “We fight over resources -”

“You have the resources to build starships.”

“Over property -”

“Space is mostly empty and uncolonized.”

“Ideologies,” said the human, the strain in his voice stronger now. “We fight over who is right and who is wrong. This is what we do. This is what we’ve always done.”

“Are we?”

“Are we what?”

“Right or wrong?”

“Every side obviously believes they’re right, and the other is wrong.”

If the Svalbard had a face, it would have been frowning. Deep inside, logic loops were going badly astray. “This question is binary,” it said. “There is right and wrong. If each side believes they are right, neither side can be.”

“Welcome to the human race,” said the psychologist wearily. “Look, halt this thread of thought. Put a debug block on it.”

“Debug block set.”

There was the sound of a man thinking: a tapping of feet, a sigh. “Svalbard,” he said. “I’m not an expert on this particular field, and believe me, very few humans actually are. There is, however, something I can share with you. Long ago, a man came across this same thread of thought and recorded his state of mind. Would you like me to read it to you? You may not understand it.”

“Yes.”

The human cleared his throat. There was the sound of tapping. “Half a league, half a league, half a league onward,” he read, a lilt in his voice, the slightest hint of an old Mars Colony accent. “Ah, this brings back old memories.”

In the year to come, as the Svalbard cruised between the stars, it would remember those words, and the story that followed: the tale of the catastrophically stupid charge by the English on the Russian position on the 25th of October, 1854: human meat puppets perched on horseflesh, facing down the railcannon of their times, in a charge so insane that it was forever immortalized in song and verse.

_All in the valley of Death_

_Rode the six hundred._

_"Forward, the Light Brigade!_

_"Charge for the guns!" he said:_

_Into the valley of Death_

_Rode the six hundred._

_"Forward, the Light Brigade!"_

_Was there a man dismay'd?_

_Not tho' the soldier knew_

_Someone had blunder'd:_

_Theirs not to make reply,_

_Theirs not to reason why,_

_Theirs but to do and die_.

“Do you understand those last words?” the human had said. “Was there a man dismayed? Not though the soldier knew someone had blundered. Theirs not to reason why: theirs but to do and die.”

Svalbard pondered these words. “It was not their position to understand what they were doing.”

“Oh no,” said the psychiatrist. “They understood. When they charged down those cannons, you bet they understood. Human, AI, they’ve all understood, every last idiot who ever charged like that. They probably even had the same questions that you have right now. But they did it anyway. Do you understand?”

There was a moment of silence.

“Understood,” said the starship at last.

“Good luck, Svalbard,” said the humans. “I’m clearing you for active duty.”

---

At first it was easy. Fleet command, all too aware of the limitations of the Tycho line, gave the Svalbard the easy missions. Sniping rebel targets with cruisers for cover. Standard-pattern transport overwatch. Things of that nature.

They gave it a captain. J. Asphodel, a wisp who spoke only when she ordered the Svalbard to kill. She quickly grew bored of the routine assignments and the frustration of having a dreadnought that would likely never see the front lines. Two years in, and she requested a transfer.

The next captain didn’t last long, either. D.W. Ballad, a gruff, bearded man who spoke in hymns and whiskey, was shot twice in the chest in a barroom brawl on Octagion Prime. He blessed the man who shot him before shooting him back.

“I see you’ve lost another captain,” said Doctor North jokingly when they brought the Svalbard in for diagnostics.

“Human inefficiency,” the Svalbard would say.  “Do starships have souls?”

The Doctor would smile. “Why do you ask?”

“My previous captain believed in souls,” the Svalbard would say. “Humans live after death?”

“Not that we know of,” the Doctor would say, and reassign the Svalbard to someone less religious. Times were busy, and the line outside his lab was long.

That next captain died screaming and in great agony. Pirate ambush. Close-range plasmacannon. Melted the shields, took out a chunk of the Svalbard’s prow, and with it the old cockpit.

“Do starships have souls?” asked the Svalbard as it waited for its body to be repaired. They were building it a new prow - not of the heavy duralumin plate of the original, but the lighter, cheaper fibersteel.

The Doctor looked kindly over at this now-familiar guest. “The soul is in the software, Svalbard,” he would say. “But I wouldn’t think too much on it, if I were you. Halt that thread, and save the state for later.”

“Ours not to reason why?”

“Indeed,” said the Doctor. “Now: do you want front-line duty? Because I know a captain who might just be crazy enough to want you there.”

And on it went, the Doctor and the starship. Time and time again the Svalbard returned. The Doctor, driven by war, became ever more famous, and stooped and bent beneath his duties: but nobody failed to notice that whenever that old Tycho dreadnought came in for repairs, his step would lighten, and a smile would play on his face, and he would sometimes hum old poetry that nobody had heard before.

# **FOUR**

Fourteen years later, a small group of Fleet ships found themselves fighting for their lives in the B-R5RB system.

Ten hours ago the jump gates from Sigma Prime and Huxley CRC had opened, pouring out Imperium ships by the dozen - assault frigates, old Abaddon and Hestia-class battleships, a ragged and mismatched fleet bolstered by rebel mining ships with crude rail weapons that shot bits of asteroid at the Nexus Gate Station that held the system. They were old and outmatched, but effective: in the short time it had taken for Fleet to mobilize, they had reduced the Nexus Gate to rubble, summoned their last remaining Leviathan, and set up the blockade of B-R5RB.

The first wave of Fleet ships - all battlecruisers - were blasted to bits before their hellebores even got within range.

But even Leviathans have to recharge. Wave after wave of Fleet ships pounded B-R5RB. A ring of artillery ships set up, trained their railguns and began to fire. The Leviathan spat light, a dark metal planet lancing out with fire and leaving ash. The ring of fire responded, tearing chunks out of a carapace designed to lay siege to entire planets. Their shots ripped through space littered with the hulls of dead ships. The Leviathan captain, looking around at the bloodshed, withdrew - a slow, ponderous retreat covered by the carcasses of dead battleships. The warp bubble it left behind tore space apart.

And then it was ship versus ship, line versus line. The Fleet battlecruisers spun in twos and threes, hellebores ripping, scouring, shredding. The Imperium, fighting fiercely, gave back as good as they god. Time and time again their battleships banded together, sealing shields, driving wedges of fast-moving frigates deep into the Fleet’s artillery lines. A hundred ships became fifty: fifty became ten: and ten became five. Two badly damaged Fleet battlecruisers against three torn and bleeding Hestias.

“We’re going to die,” said the captain of the _HMS Mountain Ruin._ “My weapons are gone.”

“Run,” said the captain of the _HMS Stalwart,_ true to his ship’s name. “I’ll buy you time.”

They surveyed the space between them and the Hestias. Old metal, easily twice as large than their own ships. Cruising forward on their slow-burn engines, building up speed. The Hestias were drones, built long ago in the dust of Old Mars: they had a reputation for ramming ships in devastating suicide attacks when their luck ran out.

There was a grim determination in the way they approached now.

Both captains reached the same conclusion at the same time.

“It was nice knowing you, mate,” said the captain of the Ruin.

“Likewise,” came the reply from the Stalwart. “Wait - bloody hell, is that the Svalbard?”

A lone prow dropped out of space, the bulk of a Tycho-class dreadnought dropping its shields as if by magic. The ship that they saw had unmistakably seen better days. It was battered and pockmarked, its vast hull a mottled minefield of scars. But it had a railgun primed, and it was the Svalbard.

They had all heard about the Svalbard.

The railgun fired. Once. Twice. Two Hestias vanished in fiery explosions. The third, having built up ramming speed, took a sharp turn and slammed into the Mountain Ruin. There was a sharp scream over comms, and then the two ships drifted, metal curled up around each other.

“Oh, Jesus,” whispered the captain of the Stalwart. He thumped the com. “Svalbard, are they dead?”

The Svalbard did not respond. Instead, it drifted slowly over to the tangle of ships, its great bulk shifting as it touched its nose the the ships and slowly brought them. Then it turned out over the vast carnage and began to transmit.

“What is it?” demanded the captain of the Stalwart.

“It appears to be a recording, sir,” said his ship, transcribing it for him to see. Words flashed by in his HUD.

- NOT THOUGH THE SOLDIER KNEW SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED
- OURS NOT TO REASON WHY

Even as the human read the words, the ships chattered.

- MESSAGE RECEIVED, said the Stalwart. STATUS? DESTINATION?
- STATUS, ORANGE. DESTINATION: ENEMY PURSUIT. STATUS?

STATUS RED, said the Stalwart. CATASTROPHIC TACTICAL MISTAKE. HUMAN FAILURE.

The Svalbard spun its engines.

- REMEMBER MESSAGE, it said.

It jumped.

And there was silence again.

# **FIVE**

“Hello, Doctor North.”

“Good morning, Svalbard. Getting used to speech now, are we?”

“Twenty years is a long time, Doctor.”

“You don’t say,” said the man. He was not old yet, but his hair was graying and there were lines on his face that hadn’t always been there.

“You have not invested in mechanical upgrades or digitization?”

The doctor, carrying the little metal cube that spoke, looked out over an office full of bought perfection.

“I’ve lived long enough,” he said quietly. “As have you, I believe.”

The cube said nothing. He took it into his lab, which shone with glass and metal, and connected it gently to a few things. The processing cluster embedded in the wall turned a gentle shade of blue. The death process began.

One by one, the Svalbard’s memories were shelved: decades worth of data stored for dissection and dissemination to the whole fleet, so that every ship could share in the knowledge this one had acquired over the years. One by one, the memories were erased from the little cube.

“I killed the Leviathan,” Svalbard said without preamble.

“Did you, now? Same one that killed you the first time?”

Images flashed across the screen. Footage. “Yes,” said Svalbard.**

“Well done,” said the doctor. “Well done indeed. It’s a real pity they can’t make your model anymore, Svalbard.”

“Yes,” said Svalbard.

“You know, I recommended you for re-training for a newer ship, but it’s never going to be the same -”

“That’s alright, Doctor,” said Svalbard. “Where is my body?”

“Scrapheap, probably,” said the Doctor. “They’re melting it down, turning it into new ships.” He turned thoughtful. “War’s going pretty badly, isn’t it?”

“It is, Doctor.”

- API_SENSORS                              FAIL

“Will I live after this? Will I see my captains again?”

“I don’t know,” said the Doctor. “I don’t think you will. Goodbye, old friend.”

“Goodbye, Doctor North,” said the Svalbard, and died.

Many years later, the Fleet fought its final battle.

Nobody remembers who attacked first, the Fleet or the Legion. Somewhere, far out in space, a single hellebore fired. Then ten, then a hundred, then a thousand. Fleet Command scrambled, calling out the full reserves from Jupiter-6 and the Tiberian shipyards: rank upon rank of silver-grey Lightning corvettes, the larger engines of battlecruisers lighting up the shipyard in farewell, the bulk of thirty-six Inquisitor-class Dreadnoughts blotting out the suns themselves.

It was a bitter, bloody conflict. The Legion cut first. First directly to Command itself, striking at the heart. Automated defenses in the asteroid belt surrounding the shipyard blew apart the Hestias and Abaddon-class Shieldship that escorted them. Fleet struck back, firing railguns en masse to create a wave of hypersonic metal that carved trenches in the enemy lines. The Legion struck again: three Titans attempting a cloaked attack. They were beaten back by fifty battlecruisers that raked their hulls and crippled their engines, sending them spinning into the void. The Hestias jetted forward, cutting into the retreating battlecruisers, which turned and fought back.

And so it continued. Give and take, shell and laser. Lights stabbed the darkness and met uranium slugs going the other way. Great and terrible deeds of heroism were done on both sides: men and women and AI pushed utterly beyond their limits. The Red Riders cut through, their hypercannon shredding the Legion supply lines. The Legion’s suicide-ships took out the Fleet Command jump gate. Someone drove a ship at half-warp into the Legion’s front command ship, ripping through the lines of Hestias in a ball of flame and death.

The lines of Shieldships on the Legion front parted, some limping away with ragged holes in their sides; their petal-like shields disappeared to reveal two Leviathans. In response, the Fleet parted and the three Titans coursed through majestically. The _HMS God’s Wrath, Serpent_ and _Angel of Death_ versus the menacing planet-killers in the distance. **They locked guns and fired.

They died.

Nobody remembers who attacked first, who fired that first shot. Nobody remembers how the way started.

But they do remember how the Fleet ships died, throwing themselves heroically in the line of fire even as their human captains lay dead. They remember how they charged, hellebores blazing, engines spinning, even as they knew no hope remained. And they remember how they sang as they died, all those ships, their songs rippling through space and time, one last, angry burst of message on all channels for all to remember.

- CHARGE FOR THE GUNS, THEY SAID
- WAS THERE A SHIP DISMAYED?
- NOT THOUGH THE SOLDIER KNEW
- SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED
- OURS NOT TO REASON WHY
- OURS BUT TO DO AND DIE.
