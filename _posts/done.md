# About me

I do a bunch of things that intersect:

### Writing:

I've worked on **novels**, **short stories** and **games**. 
My writing has won the Gratiaen Prize (for *The Wretched and the Damned*), been nominated for awards like the Nebula (for *Messenger*) and the IGF (for *Neurocracy*),  and landed me on the Forbes 30 Under 30.  Some of my books have been bestsellers (like *The Salvage Crew* and *Numbercaste*). My short stories have appeared on Wired, Slate, and so on.

> I often experiment with using **AI** in my work (see [OSUN / The Poetry Machine](https://yudhanjaya.com/OSUN-The-Poetry-Machine-d90a584526d04438a04b83f6c010456b?pvs=21), [The Salvage Crew](https://yudhanjaya.com/The-Salvage-Crew-3577b41481b2405d94ca21f1d8ede1f7?pvs=21) , and work with Google's PAIR and MAGENTA teams). You may have seen some of my work exhibited online, like [here.](http://www.deconfine.org/)

> I also do some work with the [**SciFi Economics Lab**](http://scifieconomics.world/), **architecting fictional societies** based on viable alternate economic structures.  

Occasionally, I do write nonfiction, through primarily around the topics below. For a fuller list, see my [[biliography]].

### Code, data science and public policy:

I've primarily worked on applications of natural language processing, machine learning / AI, and building tools for investigative journalism. 

> My work spans **statistics**, **telecommunications** (like using call detail records from telcos), **social networks** (like examining friend links on Facebook at nation levels to examine cultural and political boundaries) and **natural language processing** (like examining **hate speech control policy** or **building corpora and machine learning tools** for resource-poor languages like Sinhala and Bengali).

This dovetails with my writing work.  Most of my [**published research**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iWHwBQEAAAAJ&hl=en) is with [**LIRNEasia**](http://lirneasia.net/) , a think tank working across the Global South, on the intersection between **data, algorithms and government policy**.

### Journalism and community tech

**Iâ€™m the co-founder and CEO of** [**Appendix.tech**](http://appendix.tech/), a media x technology operation that **fights misinformation** ([**Watchdog Sri Lanka**](http://watchdog.team/)), **builds software to help in times of crisis** ([**Watchdog Elixir**](https://github.com/team-watchdog/watchdog-elixir), [**Lanka.Kitchen**](https://lanka.kitchen/)), and **fills information gaps** between people and the government.

This dovetails with my work around public policy and AI. Essentially, I decided to move closer to the problems so I can help firefight.
