## Synopsis

Solus wants to be a musician.

## Progress

26/12/2022

Well over 60K words now. Second arc complete. I haven’t touched OM in about half a month. The diabetes and cholesterol diagnoses have led to some much-needed changes in my life. On the whole, adjusting to meds, wrapping up Watchdog work for the year. I’m not worried about the book anymore: it’s at that stage where the words write themselves. I keep returning to Origami Meteorite; as the world gets more chaotic, it’s a reminder that even in chaos, there is great beauty, and that one must imagine the proverbial Sisyphus to be happy. The tapestry is much richer than I originally imagined, and I just need to sit down for things to come to me.

Work continues at a steady clip. I estimate I'm getting about three days a week in, at between 1400 and 2400 words a day. The heatwave in Colombo is now my biggest enemy - by daytime the walls start radiating heat inward and turn our brains into scrambled mush. I’ve reset my writing time to 7:45 AM to compensate.

Rewrote opening arc (35 K words); structure is now satisfactory and lets me access the rest of the story. New interlude structure is much more enjoyable. Porting to separate folder in IA writer, cleaning up.

## Seed

By Jun 2021, I was done with both The Salvage Crew and The Inhuman Peace. I had spent most of my time locked down, ploughing through work on machine learning for misinformation detection.

Despite the fact that I had several books lined up, I couldn’t bring myself to write anything. The Inhuman War (the planned sequel) was a dark book. The State of Data required heavy revising after COVID-19. These were books on contract. Expansions of the Numbercaste and Salvage Crew universes had to go through some serious logistics before they became reality. I was at a point in my life where I was burned out and increasingly depressed, both with myself as a researcher and as a writer.

I had long been a fan of a category of music mostly found on YouTube - instrumental backgrounds, mostly generated on synthesizers. There are some insanely talented artists out there - Celldweller and Audiomachine were old favourites, and as I went through the YouTube rabbit hole I stumbled across others that really set a mood. Especially Bertysolo and TellingBeatzz (Thomas Hodek); these tracks felt like set pieces for what was going through my head when I sat watching the rain, at night, with a cigarette in hand, wondering whether it was worth waking up the next day.

At some point I ended up watching this video of FKJ live at Salar De Uyini. I watched this musician clearly having the time of his life on this stunning salt flat, moving between instruments, incorporating everything - from the sound of the wind to his own mistakes - into one long, endless piece of magic, and it seemed that he was playing for himself above all.

It was magical.

And so decided to take a little detour from own nihilism. I began writing a different book altogether, one that felt truer to my state of mind: a musician in a cyberpunk world, trying (and failing) to create a career for themselves.

I had a bunch of fantastic ideas on trips with Nisal and conversations with Ronnie, so pretty soon I had notes upon notes upon notes. I wanted this book to be an intentional anti-thesis to everything I’d done so far. My worlds are often poor, nasty, brutish; ‘high-tech low-life’, so to speak. I wanted a world that felt hopeful. I wanted to draw on my own experiences and show that life continues even at the margins - including love, hope, dreams, art, all those things that get us through the day.

By December, I was busy raising funds for Appendix / Watchdog, hiring people, going about all the work of making Watchdog A Real Company, so by early 2022 my work on OM was largely focused on: writing the opening scenes, testing out the characters, getting a feel for how large the story was - and getting a sense for the actual story. By January 2023 I had some [26,500 words in the bag](https://twitter.com/yudhanjaya/status/1479939353585594374).

I was guilty of over-engineering this one - I spent so long trying to shoehorn various allusions and structures into this that at some point I went through my plot notes and realised I’d lost the joy of it. What helped was going back, looking at the links between the characters and the places, and watching my ideas flit between them and stitch together a world that I actually found beautiful. Fortunately, my [reliance on knowledge graphs and Obsidian came in handy](https://twitter.com/Hugo_Book_Club/status/1508838952383524871).
