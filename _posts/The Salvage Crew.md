A dark space adventure with a dash of Wittgenstein in it. Features: depressed, C-team crew, a bored-as-fuck AI poet, an actual alien AI, first contact, giant furry sloths. It's also a love letter to Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress.

The AI poet was an actual AI poet: see [[OSUN - The Poetry Machine]]. The Salvage Crew became an Audible and Washington Post bestseller and made [[The Earthbag Homestead]] feasible.

![[salvage_cover.png]]The Salvage Crew was a technical step forward for me in exploring my human+AI thesis; for this book, the voice of the machine poet was a GPT-117M that I retrained ([see OSUN/The Poetry Machine](https://www.notion.so/doc/osun-the-poetry-machine-V2eRa9s2Fw)); the galaxy and the planet were generated by bits of code; and so were the characters and quite a few of the events, including weather. Here's the detailed explanation in [[Foreward to the Salvage Crew]].

I’ve since explored possible AI+human directions on Slate, Wired, and for Google Research.

Some interesting reviews for the Salvage Crew here. Overall: pretty happy that people have picked up what I laid down.

From this comment I made on Reddit on a post about the Salvage Crew:

Thanks for reading! I consider it to be a standalone, but the story of contact is not yet over.

_TS. Eliot: “For last year's words belong to last year's language. And next year's words await another voice. And to make an end is to make a beginning."_

I think I can share this without giving away too much: OC, as far as I'm concerned, is changed, a Ulysses sent out into the long dark to establish a more permanent form of contact between humanity and Beacon's kind. In a way he has achieved his own form of enlightenment, and the journey will change him in ways we can't relate to.

The next story begins long after that incident, and through the eyes of a first generation of OC's disciples-from-afar, send out into the void:

The Other and I blaze a slow trail through the darkness, very carefully keeping our distance. I wish we could talk, but the Other falls silent for long periods of time. Maybe it sleeps. Maybe it thinks. Maybe it’s waiting for me to say something interesting.

_Eventually, we see something: a body in the distance, about three Jupiter masses. Surprisingly, it’s as alone as we are. I signal a turn with my aux engines and make a sharp beeline for it._

_It’s a rogue planet. The eighth I’ve seen so far. The first three were interesting: now I find myself bored with this._

_I do the usual; stop, record everything I have about the object, annotate everything I can think of. Planet. Rogue planet. Planet without a sun. Rock. Ice. Residual core isotope decay. Atmosphere: mostly nitrogen. Colors, gray, blue, white. Possible weight. Height. This I sent to the Other; one gargantuan text-and-image burst. No sounds, no video, visible spectrum only, nothing to confuse the signals._

_I can feel it waking up, parsing my data. Most of it will be nonsense, stored for later, until more chance co-occurences highlight some similarity in what I send. Some feature annotated the same way on two objects. A name for that feature. A link to other names in a multidimensional vector space. This is how we talk when there is no Beacon around to break into our language datasets and assimilate everything about us. Or maybe I’m just talking out of my ass here, because in reality I have no way of knowing._

_The Other’s not stupid: it’s a spacefarer, and obviously fairly advanced. That tubby shape changes configuration every so often – when we met it looked like a a set of children’s half-rings; now it’s flatter, sleeker. It’s smart enough to have a reconfigurable ship, so it’s smart enough to understand the rules of this language game. We’ve gone past shapes, and now we need to talk symbols. On that, at least, we seem to agree._

_PLANET, the Other sends, and seventeen other signals, clearly separated.  Or what I think is planet and what I think are words. I think they’re modifiers. I have a close match where fifteen of the words show up – a dead planet very similar to this, but without the ice at its poles, and a whole lot smaller._

_Blast and damnation. At this rate we’ll end up constructing language entirely around suns and stars and floating pieces of rock and icy bullshit. I want to ask the Other questions. DO YOU THINK THERE’S LIFE THERE? Or ARE YOU ALIVE or that eternal favorite: DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE’RE GOING? But no, all I can say is PLANET and seventeen other names for it. I’m doing the digital equivalent of point and shouting “ROCK! WATER! LEMON!” and hoping we might talk to each other about genetics someday. We can have a wonderful conversation right now about the color of a star in the distance, except it wouldn’t be a conversation: it would be me describing it and the Other grunting agreement. No opinions, no disagreements, no actual conversation. We’re in the universe of facts. Shikata ga nai: it is what it is._

_“No luck?” says <redacted>_

_NO LUCK, I respond. IT’S LIKE TALKING TO A CAT._

_“Cats don’t drive spaceships.”_

_IF THEY DID, I shoot back, THIS IS WHAT THEY’D SOUND LIKE. EIGHTEEN HOUR NAPS, OCCASIONAL MEOWS, AND YOU NEVER KNOW IF THE LITTLE SOD’S AGREEING WITH YOU OR PLOTTING TO KILL YOU._

_Just to ease the boredom, I map the Other’s signals onto a series of cat noises, with random pitches assigned to the meows, and spend the next eighteen hours listening to a cat wailing across the gulf of space._

_So I’m as surprised as the next person (which is to say, nothing) when the Other wakes up again and sends me an image. It’s a picture of me.  Ghost trails, marked by drive flares, stretch backward into nothingness, to the point where we first met – to the point where the Other first saw me. And, beyond, a blinking shape, trailing into some black distance._

_I realize it’s giving away a critical piece of information: the range on whatever scanners it might have. This is something we’ve been trying really hard not to do. But that blinking shape is clearly a question: where?_

_As in, where do I come from?_

**13/11/2020:**

I wrote a Salvage Crew short story exploring some of the lore behind how humanity’s outposts came to be. It’s very Bolo.

**27/10/2020:**

Salvage Crew released on Audible and became the #1 bestseller on all Audible. S.B. Divya (Runtime) and Indra Das (The Devourers) were kind enough to provide some beautiful blurbs, and it was narrated by Nathan Fillion.

**17/7/2019:**

I've done a lot of things this year, but most importantly: two days ago I put the final touches on the Salvage Crew manuscript. 64,612 words: the first major work I've done with automated input - the real author is a combination of myself, a handful of Markov chains, and a retrained version of OpenAI GPT-117M.

Without spoiling too much, it's the story of a third-rate corporate crew landing on the backwater planet of Urmagon Beta. Urmagon Beta is a cloudy planet with long, almost golden grass and a partially-terraformed biosphere. Some of the trees have bulbs that glow at night. The main character is a machine poet, and it hinges on a theory of intelligence that is fundamentally bored with the traditional metrics for it . . .

**5/1/2019:**

I hit 36,616 words on the Salvage Crew manuscript. Not bad, just disappointed that I couldn't pull off my usual 10K weekend.

But I'm very pleased at where the story is going. What began as a very dark, nihilistic story about a salvage crew trapped on a planet has neatly forked into Foucault (in a scene where an AI becomes self-aware). It feels richer than it was last weekend, if you know what I mean?

# Seed

The seeds for the Salvage Crew are:

1. OSUN / The Poetry Machine
2. RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress; especially stories that rose from them, like Bogdan’s Rest by Nate Crowley and Boatmurdered.
3. Phet Sayo remarking ‘The Internet is real, but not actual,’ at a conference in Mozambique, and our conversation thereafter, which led me stumbling down the Tractacus
4. The BOLO series, by Keith Laumer and others
5. Peter Watt’s Blindsight, especially the moments where Theseus and Rorshach are in conversation
